TITLE: My fellow redditors! Within reason.. turn your ridiculous ideas into porn!
POST: Soo there isn't a question in the headline.. How about.. Reddit, what kind of porn would you make if you could?

Be respectful. I may be a whore, but I'm a human being above all else!

I am in the process of developing a website for my alter ego porn star. 

I've decided that aside from all the normal boring porn stuff that I want really memorable pornos. Full length movies or short clips.

So far we are having a scenario where I am dared to suck off a corpse in a morgue.

I'm also going to fuck every super hero to which a costume is available and I am particularly excited about that!

Giant mud pit. Need I say more?

Sadly, unicorn porn was already made...

So, in this vast pool of insane and colorful minds that is reddit.. I ask you to share with me elaborate or not so elaborate ideas for porn. They don't all have to be silly, some things you legitimately might want to see and never do or never see enough of it.

In all seriousness your idea could get turned into the real thing and if it does I will send you a free copy of the production so you can show your friends!

TITLE: Is my gf(18) loosing her mind or is it me(20)?
POST: My **gf(18)** started taking **birth control almost a month ago(3 month relationship; ongoing)**. A couple days after she started shes been less happy, more tired, and completely pissed, at **me(20)** thou. She claims everything I do is wrong and always my fault. If I bring the thought of maybe its the pills she rages on me. She tells me I'm lucky if she lets me even see her. I ask her what I do that is wrong but its always 'everything'. She hasn't went through a full day without getting at me for something random even if I wasn't there. She seems to **only attack me** with this anger and lately its so emotional it's making me want to leave but I do love her. Even a happy ""I love you text"" once in a while is **now considered 'CLINGY'**. She never started this way. I'm hoping it's the pills because I don't want to leave her. Any ideas?

TITLE: How can I convince my BF to throw out all his useless stuff without being a naggy GF?
POST: Hey /r/self! Me and my lovely bf live together currently, but we are moving again in about a month. We are a college student and a recent grad respectively, but unlike most students (including me) he does not have a parent's house where some of his possessions are, so these are all his worldly possessions, and there's no where to store all the inconvenient stuff other than just letting it live in our apartment, untouched.

But that's sort of the problem. Over the course of our relationship, I have helped him move 3 times. And every single time I help him move, we spend hours moving things that have not even been looked at or touched since the *last* time I helped him move.

He insists that all of these things are important, when they are obviously not, he keeps them in broken, ugly plastic milk crate bins and they just take up space and waste our time and energy when we inevitably move them yet again.

How can I convince him to sit down with me so we can go through this stuff and throw out what's completely useless? What are the tactics for this? He gets so defensive when I suggest throwing these things out, because to him, I'm asking him to throw out all these things that are 'sentimental' or 'not useless' like old books that 'might be worth something' or a free frisbees from college, etc.

TITLE: PSA: Endomorphs, ectomorphs, and mesomorphs are not real
POST: In the general weight loss and fitness community, I frequently hear these terms casually thrown around to explain one's ability to lose/gain/maintain weight at a certain rate. From my tattoo artist who is now a competitive bodybuilder to my SO when we started this journey, it has been a consistent cause of frustration for me, as these terms- as well as constitutional psychology in general- has been discredited for years.

Constitutional psychology was developed by a psychologist named William Herbert Sheldon in the 1940's. He asserted that the human body could be split up into three ""somatotypes""- the endomorph, ectomorph, and mesomorph. He wrote a book on the topic in the 50's called *Atlas of Men*. Each somatotype was characterized as representing a different temperament, level of intelligence, and overall value. It had/has foundations in racism and antisemitism. 

The three types were described as follows (from Wikipedia): 

Ectomorphic: characterized as linear, thin, fragile, lightly muscled, flat chested and delicate; described as cerebrotonic inclined to desire isolation, solitude and concealment; and being tense, anxious, restrained in posture and movement, introverted and secretive.

Mesomorphic: characterized as hard, rugged, rectangular, athletically built with well developed muscles, thick skin and good posture; described as somatotonic inclined towards physical adventure and risk taking; and being vigorous, courageous, direct and dominant.

Endomorphic: characterized as round and soft with under-developed muscles and having difficulty losing weight; described as viscerotonic enjoying food, people and affection; having slow reactions; and being disposed to complacency.

I just wanted everyone to recognize that though it would be very convenient to have this wonderful defiance of the laws of thermodynamics to excuse the inability or lack of desire to lose weight, they have long since been disproven and to use these terms is intellectually dishonest. Barring other physical disabilities, your body type does NOT determine your ability to lose or gain weight at a relatively normal pace.

POST: I am separated and will likely be divorced.  My husband and I have been together since I was in college and I literally feel like I have no idea how to date.  Everything is online?  God I feel so old saying that.  I know Tinder is mostly for hookups?  I'd like to go on some actual dates, but am not looking for anything serious, just want to start meeting some people.  But having sex with someone, I don't know at this point.  I was never much into casual sex (serial monogamist here) so that thought terrifies me too.  I really have no idea what the best way is to go about putting myself out there a bit.  I'm generally pretty attractive, decent body type, so I get attention from men but dating...??  Ugh.

When we did I had said I would date someone either two years younger or two years older then me. Not thinking that the two years younger would matter to me. I ended up meeting a girl who is just that two years younger then me. I now fin myself questioning whether or not it is a good idea. She has one more year of highschool to go through and my last relationship had to much highschool bs. I would really like to date her but I find myself stopping because: She is still a minor, she has that one more year of highschool. Stupid as that may be it bugs me i mean if I was 20 and she was 18 and out of highschool I would have no problem with it! I find myself questioning morals of if it is right or not or what would happen if something went wrong? What does reddit think?

TITLE: So AT&T tried to get my commit insurance fraud, how should I handle this situation?
POST: As ridiculous as that sounds I'm about 90% sure thats what happened... So a few days ago I called into AT&T about my recently stolen phone. The representative went over what was probably a usual script of trying to remedy the problem, this included the options of either extremely expensive no contract replacement phones or cheaper but fairly outdated phones(I still had my old phone and was using it at this point so buying something like that was pointless). The conversation dragged on and on about how few options there were for me and how little there could be done since I lost my phone 2 months after buying it. 
Then finally she told me she would talk to her supervisor about it. Couple minutes on hold she comes back and tells me that her supervisor told her that she could put insurance on my phone which she KNEW was already stolen so that I may claim it, which would only cost $125. At this point I was willing to try anything, and $125 for a new Galaxy S which was usually 500 outside of contract sounded good to me. So I called the insurance company told them exactly what happened, when it happened, and it didn't go through, OF COURSE it didn't, but why would an AT&T rep tell me to do such a thing, and why did her supervisor tell her to do that. 
So I called back today got on the line with another supervisor and he didn't have much to tell me other than sorry, he gave me a few more options but those included buying some where else, adding a new line just to buy another phone or doing an early activation for $200(how is that any different since most contract phones are $200 more than non-contract), I will say he allowed me to check if my old phones IMEI was in use yet which it wasn't, unfortunately.

TITLE: Looking for advice on starting my career
POST: Hey reddit, I am a 22 year old male who just moved out for the first time down to North Carolina from Illinios. I have little to no college experience, basically a semester shy of an associates. 

The first job I landed down here was with a major car rental company, (the yellow one) as a ""manager trainee"" making roughly 28k a year (32 with overtime). My background previous to this was working as a shift manager at a health club back in Illinois as well as a number of smaller customer service/sales positions in retail. 

So far I enjoy my job but it seems to have a very high turnover rate due to the ""turn and burn"" nature of the position, however this also does provide decent room for advancement. 

My ultimate goal is to land a more business to business sales positionnwith better job security than my current position, the only drawbacks being my lack of college degree and ""professional"" experience. I feel as if I can stick it out at this company for a year so and land a promotion or two, I can use it to springboard to a more stable position in a more corporate environment, perhaps with a materials distributor (electrical, shipping/recieving, even HR? etc)

My question for you all is should I follow this plan? or move back home with my parents when my year lease is up and finish my degree? So far I'm doing well with this company but I worry if I have a couple bad months or two and am let go, (a theme I've already witnessed with a couple coworkers) it would look horrible on a resume, and only serve to put me in a worse position. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I just didn't know if anyone has been in a similar position, and could offer some advice.

TITLE: My friend told me [21/M] about a friend of his and is sort of teasing the idea of talking to her about me.
POST: Last night, I was texting a friend of mine and he casually mentions this girl he's friends with who, as we both see her, is very cute. I'm not exactly sure why, but he starts telling me about her and it turns out that, on interests alone, we're incredibly similar. Everything from peculiar music taste, to hobbies, to basically everything. (And her hometown is just a few hours from mine, but that's pretty mundane.) Basically, I think she's really cute and I'm sort of in awe at how similar we are based off what he's told me, because that doesn't happen to me too often.

When my friend first told me about her, he agreed he would talk to her when he was less busy, then a few minutes later joked and said I should go to Boston (where she's currently studying). He's done this like three times now, and it's to the point where I'm just thinking, ""Oh well.""

I'm not saying I deserve to talk to her, nor am I saying there's even a chance, but we both agree it seems like we're incredibly similar, and I'd love to talk with her (if she's interested, of course!). I'm getting the impression he sort of has a crush on her, so he's not willing to do anything. How can I ask him without sounding like an asshole/desperate?

TITLE: I (28/m) like this girl (18/f) that I work with but my life isn't really in order....
POST: I've been working with this girl for 6 months now and we get along great. We don't talk or hang out outside of work, but I really enjoy spending time with her.

It is only recently that I have started thinking about her as more than a friend and I would like to get to know her more outside of work and such, but there are some issues I am worried about.

As I said, my life is not exactly in order. I got out of a relationship a year ago and at the end I had no car, lost my savings, and am now living with her step-dad(paying rent though) so that may not be such a great thing. But I have a vehicle now too at least but its not that great. 

The age thing is weird. I mean, my parents met at 18 and 28, so it happens, but it is something to consider. Her level of maturity, life experience, etc. 

That being said though, as of now I wouldn't be expecting a huge thing from it such as us building a life together, getting, married, etc.
No, I was just thinking of it as someone to get to know, go out with, and see what happens. Especially since I've only had one seriously girlfriend in my life. 

I have no idea if I would be her type or how she feels at all. I'm not in the best shape but I wouldn't say I am ugly. Who knows what her opinion is.

So am I worried about rejection? No I cant say that is what I'm worried about. I could handle that, but I wouldn't want to ruin what we do have as co-workers/friends. I wouldn't change how I treat her if she said no, but I don't know about her. 

Basically I don't know how to go about it or if it's worth it at all. Ive never had to deal with this before lol. My last and only relationship was one that lasted 7 years and just kinda happened.

I eat lunch with some coworkers every day, 7 total: Me, Roslyn, Jack, Nicky,Robert, Beth, and Kristie. Well, *used* to eat lunch with them, until I stopped. I found their conversations to always rotate to either bitching about work or about videogames. 

Anyway, I decided to eat lunch at a local store instead of at work. One of the coworkers (and actual friends, Roslyn) joined me, which I'm fine with that, as the conversations tends to be about other things other than just work and videogames.

About a month passes and Beth asks me if she can go join me and Roslyn for lunch at the store for lunch. I'm ok with it, and so is Roslyn. We have been going about once a week to have lunch at the store now. Kristie has joined us as well...

Which leaves Jack, Nicky, and Robert at the cafeteria. I'm having problems with Nicky, as she takes it as a personal insult that she and Jack haven't been invited to the store... But that's the catch: I never invited anyone to join me. Now she decided to send me a nasty message online through work email. 

Do I confront her directly, or do I contact my supervisor about this issue? I still have the message she sent me in ky inbox.

POST: We both work together, and I consider her a good friend. The past couple of months I started to feel something for her. I really admire her. She's smart, up beat, great personality, hard working, and overall she makes me want to be a better person.

 I got her number, and we would text like crazy. And at work, we would talk about all kinds of things. It was overall fun.

 I later would ask if she wanted to go anywhere, like get coffee or something, and she would say she was busy. Then a month ago I asked if she wanted to go to the movies and she says ""sure as friends"". In a way, I felt bad, but did my best to just accept it. (hey, maybe she will get to know me better atleast).  

 So far we haven't gone, I only brought it up during her time off from school, but she seems to be always busy. 

 At the same time, it just started to feel like we're getting distant. We talk, and she no longer looks at me, texting has been one sided(where I initiate), and mostly her side is reduced to one word answers. She no longer looks for me to talk to.

 Overall, I miss my friend, I have feelings for her, and I think she might suspect that. I'm trying to let it go, and I just want to hit the reset button and bring back things to the way they were. 

 I'm hurting and I'm frustrated. I felt like I mattered and now I feel like I'm losing her and right now she's the closest friend I got.

 I just want her to realize that I am not looking to make this more than a friednship, and want her to know that I consider her my closest friend(between you redditors and I, i would love to for it to be more than what it is, but I don't think it's worth losing her completely).

Back story on my aunt: she has been a leech for the past 15 years.

We didn't do anything on our first couple of dates. Not even holding hands or hugging. On the third date, I walked her to her door, and I wanted to give her a kiss goodnight. Next thing I know, we're making out on her porch. So I pull away after five minutes and I tell her that I gotta go home. She says: where are you going?  I wana make out some more, and she pulls me inside her house. 30 minutes later, we're at 3rd base on her couch. I then had to go home, because I had to wake up for work.  

I come from a conservative upbringing, and I'm used to dating conservative girls. Usually I'm the one pushing for more.

I'm 16M he's 12M, we don't see each other a lot because of school and sports so we aren't exactly close. He was in a 'relationship' a couple of months ago and apparently took it harshly when she broke up with him. Now recently he left his email logged in and his most recent mail was a conversation with his 'ex' and he was spouting some pretty over the top stuff like ""can't stand to be without you"" ""I'd do anything for you"" etc.

So I understand that he's being a stupid middle schooler and middle schoolers are stupid, its not like I wasn't like that and didn't regret stuff I said/did back in middle school hell even freshman year of high school. So part of me wants to just let him figure it out on his own and have some regrets but get through it.

On the other hand though, I was wondering if I should try to be a good big brother and give him some advice. I certainly would have appreciated some honest advice when I was in middle school, and I think it could help him out. So moral of the story I don't really know what to do.

POST: Hi AskReddit!

Been lurking here for a while now, and thought I'd posit a question that's been worrying me lately.

Just a little bit of context:
I live in Sydney, Australia, and took a gap year after graduating high school (unsure if there is an equivalent of a gap year for those living in other countries, but it's basically an optional year off before university/college starts here in Oz).
Now, I intended that gap year to be a year to get some more work at my part time job and save a little cash, but due to some unforeseen circumstances (girlfriend dumping me, the tremendous power of my laziness/procrastination), the year quickly turned into me being a hermit and staying home, moping about.

Now, having grown accustomed to the life of the hermit, I'm tremendously nervous about entering university; the whole social aspect, in particular, is incredibly frightening to me.

I want to be more social, expand my knowledge/experience, be more engaging as a person, get out of the house more, and get back into the dating game.

Any tips Reddit?

TITLE: Youtube Revenge
POST: This was during February/March of 2012.

I had previously won an online contest of $100 for a game called Starcraft 2 back in August to my PayPal. Having only spent half of my winnings, I decided to purchase Modern Warfare 3 on Steam. However, the game cost $60, instead of the usual $50 of many other games, so I was $10 short. 

I really wanted to play MW3, though. So, I googled on how to get it for cheaper, and found an old forum I used to visit. Apparently, there was a person selling the game for $25. I messaged him, and he messaged back, and a deal was negotiated. We exchanged messages for a while, as he was taking a while getting a cd-key for me. I, stupidly ""gifted"" the money instead of purchasing it as he was getting the key for me, since I was pretty new to PayPal. Then randomly, he logged off. The whole process was around two hours I believe.

Having not seen him on for a few days, I concluded that I got scammed. Whatever, I thought. It was only $25. I was surprised that a person went through such great lengths to con a mere $25. Anyways, after that, I brainstormed ways of trying to get revenge. He stupidly put his ""IGN"" as his Skype name (Program I used to message him), and it wasn't a common one either so it was incredibly simple to find all his other accounts (youtube, steam, etc). 

When I went to his Youtube channel, I came up with a master plan, and decided to use a ""dislike bot"" to dislike his videos. He seemed to be an avid Youtuber, since he uploaded around one video a week.

I managed to get 90+ dislikes on each of his videos.... He stopped posting videos as frequently after that... even though he was still active on his channel. (Latest Activity thing on Youtube)

TITLE: My girlfriend [22F] says that I [23M] cannot watch porn, but she says it's OK for her to read Fifty Shades of Grey.
POST: My girlfriend and I have been dating for a year and she has always maintained that she does not approve of me watching porn. Recently she told me she has started reading Fifty Shades of Grey and has been getting ""worked up"" when reading it. I told her that I thought it was hypocritical of her considering how adamant she is that I don't watch porn, to which her response was ""I think reading is different to watching."" I pressed her for more of a reason and she said that ""physically staring at other women is different to reading about sex"". Personally I feel like this is a huge double standard when the bottom line is both are used for the same outcome, but I'd like to get some second opinions.

TITLE: Reason enough to break things off?
POST: Try to keep this short. My SO came home from work a few hours ago, we got into a fight over something silly and he called me a cunt. Not in a joking way. We've been together for 7 months now and known each other for about a year beforehand. I'm 22F and he's 24M. 

In the past he has said other degrading things to me but I ignore them and tell myself that he does it in the heat of the moment when he gets angry but now I feel like I've had enough. 

Redditors, is it right for me to feel this way? His anger shouldn't give him a reason for him to say these things right? I've grown up in a verbally abusive household and the last thing I want is to end up with someone who's also going to verbally abuse me whether it be when he's angry or not.

TITLE: I'm poor and need a car, my old car is unrepairable, and I think I was swindled. Please help
POST: To start, my car has about 180k miles on it. One day it started stalling because it couldn't idle. I took it to a local mechanic who told me I needed a new exhaust system installed for $1,500. He also ran a compression test and told me the motor was great. I paid him and it did not fix the problem, the car still stalled.

I took the car to a different mechanic. They deduced that the problem was in fact the motor, and that I would basically need another motor, which would be another $2,000 that I could not afford. They discovered this using a compression test as well.

So, I'm asking for advice about what I should do. I need a car, but have about 2k total left to my name, and my income is not good, and student loans. Do I have options to actually sue the first mechanic?

Otherwise, of the $1,500 I paid, $900 was for the exhaust part. Is there any way I can make this money back? Does anyone know of any resources to help me sell parts of my car that I could put towards getting another one? Thank you.

POST: I'm wondering if any redditors have been in a similar situation and might be able to help out. So my mom is disabled and has had polymyositis (a nueromuscular disease) for the last four years and has not been getting better. She's divorced and I'm away at college so there's basically nobody to help her do simple things around the house (grocery shopping, cleaning, maintainence) except for my sister, who is busy in high school. She's got stacks of bills and medical receipts that she needs to pay/send to the insurance company for reimbursement; needs help filing taxes; dire straights financially. We know that there are programs out there, but have been rejected (due to value of our house and not being on welfare or of retirement age)/given the runaround from many of them. Is there any kind of personal assistant or organization that could come to her house to apply for these programs, sort through/pay her bills, file her reimbursements, help with grocery etc.? State social worker has been useless- gives us programs, but my mom has to do all the work of filing, driving, following up (which she's incapable of doing).

TITLE: The local fire department tried to block my wife and me in a local park parking lot.  Redditors, what defining moment in your life made you lose hope in humanity?
POST: So my wife and I finally had the night to ourselves with the kid at a sleepover.  We drive to the local park for a romantic(ish) walk together.  When we get back to the car and try to exit the parking area from the main exit we find it blocked off for a ""Movie in the park"" night.  This parking lot has two entrances/exits so we drive to the other one to find it also blocked off...this time by a fire truck and some of the local firemen.  As I motion to them that I need to exit, they wave me back in the direction of the turnabout that leads to the blocked main exit.  Never mind that this would be something of a hazard, there were plenty of other people who had parked before this whole blockade had been put into place.  I nicely ask the fireman to let us out and the following was out discussion:

Me: Sir, we need to get out of the parking lot.
Fire man (FM): Use the other exit, this one is blocked off.
Me: You guys blocked the other exit off, too.
FM: (gives me a blank stare for a few seconds then calls over 3 of his fellow fire fighters).

It is a good 2 or 3 minutes for them to come to the stunning conclusion that ""Hmm, this *could* be a problem"".

Eventually they decided it was best to let us and others out to return to our homes but I think I lost the last of my faith in humanity.  I also hope they never try this approach with a burning house.

TITLE: Minimum Wage Drones of Reddit, What Are Your Best Customer Harassment Stories?
POST: So I'm home from university for the summer, and I work a summer job at a large music venue directing cars in the parking lots. For some reason a majority of the people that leave the venue find it acceptable to harass the employees working in the parking lot because we only make minimum wage and therefore (in their minds) we're useless. Yesterday, a 40+ year, old beer bellied ginger man, kept telling me and my co-workers he was going to go ""Aurora Colorado"" on us, because we were ""lazy fucks"" and wouldn't help him get a cab. The thing is we don't control the cabs, and the guests have to call a cab if they want one, and its completely out of our control when the cabs come. He then started to pick fights with families waiting for cabs and kept calling some dad an ""old bitch"" in front of his family, because he wouldn't join him in harassing us. This happens almost every time I work at that music venue, for some reason people think A. min wage employees control the organization they work for and everything they don't like is their fault and B. because you're a min wage employee you're worthless and therefore its ok to harass you. So reddit, what are your best customer harassment stories towards you or any of your co-workers?

POST: We broke up on December 17, 2015.  

After the break-up, I realized just how much she meant to me.  I love her, and am still in love with her.  She's moved on (She had another guy over at her place on December 18th...)

It was tough, but I mostly got over it.  For the past 2 weeks, however, I've realized I enjoy listening to songs that remind me of her.  Songs that are related to love and such (Think Taylor Swift, 1989).  I've realized that I'm definitely not over her.  I still love her.

My question is why do I enjoy making myself sad by thinking about her?  Is this normal?  Has anyone else ever experienced this?  I find myself going out for walks just so I can listen to songs which bring back all of the old memories... Why?

We feel like a married couple, but our families and friends keep asking when we're going to get married, why we don't want to get married, want to know if we're having problems and things like that. We think marriage is really a huge thing, especially here (Italy), where getting a divorce takes at least 3 years and quite some money spending, besides that we wouldn't have problems getting married, but we talked about it and what came out of it was: if we never thought about it, there must be a reason. I'm scared we're going to rush trough it just because ""it's the right thing to do"" and it'll damage our relationship.

TITLE: Having issues at work, need advice how to handle it or if I am in the wrong
POST: I was hoping this year would start off well, started working out and tried to get in better shape.

Things did not go as planned. Working out let to severe chest pain, my doctor ran a bunch of tests and concluded its costochondritis, basically he does not know why I have pain. Pretty much told me to take pain reliever and rest it out. Pain would come and go, then one morning I could barely move my hand without flinching. So I took day off. Next day I came in to work but she told me to go home and rest after a while.

Pain gradually subsided but led way to asthma. I have not had asthma for years. Back to doctor, he gave me inhaler, was late at work. Then this week again I barely slept sunday night and told her I will be in late. I came in late around 11 and left at 5. 

So yesterday she sat me down and told me how this was performance impacting and she was giving me a soft warning for the upcoming reviews. She admitted I have not missed any timelines, but cause I am hitting all of them while taking this time I must not be working upto potential. She told me maybe I should consider using my PTO and sorting out health issues.

I do most of the complicated analysis at work. Anything complicated is thrown my way with a day or two deadlines. I understand I have been not in at work as much. But technically I just took a day off and was late here and there cause of appointments. What are my options here besides quitting. We get our bonus payout in a month.

TITLE: Would this help to end world poverty?
POST: I noticed girls posting statuses on facebook of them claiming to go to a country for an allotted time. Upon further research, I found that the enigmatic statuses were to create awareness for breast cancer. 

 I also discovered that similar status trends have happened in the past, such as naming their bra colour for breast cancer, and people changing their profile picture to their favourite cartoon to end child abuse.

Looking at the numbers, it seems to have worked. Funding for breast cancer is in the millions every year, and I asked some people if they knew about child abuse and they told me that it was a reality. Clearly the statuses worked!

Now reddit, I am asking you if we can use this technique to decimate poverty from Africa. I was thinking we should make our statuses in such a way that we mention our *favourite food* and say that we eat it on *whatever object is directly to our right*. 

In my case, ""I eat sushi on my guitar""

If we band together, we just might have enough statuses to cause an end to hunger!

Content that speaks to us a human beings. Content one would expect maybe 25,000 upvotes to let's say 4,000 downvotes, to account for trolls and such. Nope. Never. Not from what I've seen. That content will have 25,000 upvotes and 22,000 downvotes. It seems odd to me. Is there a design to reddit that's behind this? Or is it really just the way it is?

TITLE: TIFU by cashing in my Club Nintendo Points
POST: This is nowhere near as bad as the awful shit that I usually see around here, but I just need to vent.

So as many of you might have known, Club Nintendo is shutting down, and everyone's scrambling to cash in their points for something worthwhile, myself included. I haven't really been using my codes up until Mario Kart 8 came out with that offer for a free Wii game if you register it. Anyway, I cashed in all of the games I could find with redeemable codes, and soon was swimming in coins.

Now, something else you might not know is that Club Nintendo has been down for about a week or more for maintenance, something that annoyed me to no end, so much so that I went straight to cashing my coins before it went under again. I remembered the games they were offering were just either some shitty eShop game or some virtual consoles that I wasn't interested in, so, without hesitation, I decided on getting that sick new Majora's Mask message bag, almost depleting my load of coins.

I guess it was the annoyance of the incredibly long maintenance period, but it never clicked in my brain that they could have added some things to the rewards shop during that time.

After placing my order, I noticed I still had a small amount of coins left, so I decided I would see if I could waste the rest of them on a virtual console or something, so I looked into the rewards. Staring back at me was The Wonderful 101, prime and ready for buying at a mere 600 coins. I have a little under 200 now.

POST: My boyfriend and I get along very well and have a great connection. We have so much fun together and we're always laughing. The only issue is that I tend to be an active person who loves to hike, bike, play frisbee, fish, and just be outside in general.

He is the opposite. I have noticed since we started dating that I don't do these activities as much anymore because I enjoy being around him so much that I have somewhat given them up (stupid... I know). He works a lot of hours (on his feet the whole time) so I understand why he doesn't want to do these things. But it's starting to bum me out that on our days off we end up watching TV, going out to eat, or getting drinks. We are both very social/outgoing people, but he would rather go sit at a bar or try a new restaurant (which I enjoy too!) but sometimes I wanna get out and be active together. 

The last guy I was seeing (we didn't connect emotionally so it ended), loved being outdoors and staying active so I never sat on a couch. I know I can do these activities with other friends but all of my friends have now moved across states. I'm trying to connect with some people from work as of now. I know can do these things alone too, but it's such a bummer not enjoying some of my passions with my SO. I don't want to change him or his interests, and I also don't want to end it. Mostly I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience? Would *you* end a relationship over something like this? Any ideas how maybe I can talk to him about my concerns in a nice way (he is a bit overweight so it could become a sensitive topic)?

TITLE: Me [20F] with my bf [19 M] 2yrs anxiety getting in the way of happiness
POST: I am very prone to feeling anxiety, excessive worry, over-thinking and sometimes panic attacks. My boyfriend is always there for me, to talk and help me sort out my troubles, but I know it's a lot for him, especially in instances where my low points extend for long periods of time.

It's hard dealing with anxiety in a relationship, and it often makes me question whether these 'troubles' are fabricated due to my anxiety, or if they are a real problem in the relationship. Usually I can spot the real issues (that anyone outside would spot) quickly, and we sort through the issue together. We make a point to talk and talk often, but I won't deny we have had our fair share of issues.

Besides this, sometimes, I feel like the issue is deeply rooted in my anxiety. For example, sometimes I will just seemingly out of the blue wonder if this is all going to work out with him, if we will be able to get through A situation or B situation, and it spirals out of control in my head. 

Silly, seeing as when this happens, I've been given no trigger or reason to suspect anything is wrong. It happens at the worst of times too, like when things are going really well! 

I'm seeking help for my anxiety as best as I can, but I really need some advice on how to deal with this issue inside of a relationship.

I often feel like there might be a disconnect because it's hard for someone who doesn't have anxiety like my bf, to understand whats going on with me. 

It's also very hard to walk away from conversations about my anxiety, because I feel like I've failed him somehow. I usually feel quite useless after a low point, with a feeling I should be apologizing, however much my bf tells me it's okay and not to apologize.

POST: We met online playing video games and we kept talking and one thing just led to the next and we started skyping everyday. He (the 16 year old) was originally the one to say ""I love you"" and started talking seriously about the relationship and meeting up together and living together potentially in the future when he finished high school. Things were going really great I was really happy and finally looking forward to the future, he made a lot of hints of us living together like far off in the future and I thought we had this really great thing going, we talked on cam everyday and played games and watched TV shows and movies together.

Then 2 days ago he tells me that I'm a pushover, I take time to think about it and realize he's kind of right, we never really fought I've always been frightened of him leaving me so I never really disagree with him and I don't really make decisions I always say ""I don't care"" or ""you decide."" I just don't really know how to express myself, I'm fairly apathetic to most things. Then yesterday he tells me that he thinks our relationship might not last if I continue to be so unpassionate, unmotivated and not the ""dominant guy he'd like."" He said that anything can happen and he still wants to be with me now but he might not forever even if I did change because ""everything is up to chance."" I feel like he already broke up with me, I cried a bit and threw up.

Before this relationship I always thought myself as fairly dominant around my friends but I've always been a quiet introvert in large groups of people but I still have an aggressive side. Also I'm not a stereotypical gay guy either, like if you knew me you wouldn't have any idea that I was, he on the other hand is more effeminate and he has a fairly big ego and a rather large personality. I'm really afraid of losing him I just don't know what to do.

Where they had graduated > 90% of their original class (with an average GPA of about 3.0+), my graduating class was about 1/3 of the size it was intended to be (we started with 330ish, graduated about 135).  Every other district was about 2 years ahead in the curriculum compared to my high school.  My school district was in a highly urban area, where a fair portion of the student body survives on the ""free lunch"" system.  Our educational system (at least in Iowa) is currently experiencing wide spread budget cuts.  More and more I feel like, even my own siblings, are at a disadvantage when entering college because of the decline in the quality of education.  This isn't even considering the vast majority of people I know that will never make it to college simply because the system has told them ""it is not for them,"" and they repeat that sentiment.  I feel like I'm ranting, but I honestly feel like, unless you come from a ""rich"" high school today, you can be so far behind your peers upon entering college, that trying to compete with them academically becomes an even greater challenge.

My administration is wonderful, but teaching multiple preps and co-sponsoring color guard, creative writing club, and being on a positive behavior committee means my hours are closer to 80 hours a week than the 35 I spend actually teaching.

POST: Some scumbag stole my Jeep Wrangler on Friday. It was recovered, stripped and destroyed, in the ghetto of the local major city before I even knew it went missing. After filing some reports and making a few calls I determined that I couldn't go get it any time soon, so I went camping for the weekend - as previously planned. 

When I came back home Sunday, I parked my car in it's usual spot at my apartment and went inside to clean up, drop off gear and get ready to leave - I needed to find the parts to fix what I could, on my Jeep; hopefully I could make it drivable. Instead, about twenty minutes into my routine, my neighbor knocked on my door to notify me that some ass hat wrecked into my parked car while I was inside.

I had to take a day off of work yesterday to sort through this mess. I found the Jeep at the impound lot and discovered that the wheels and tires were stolen, the brand-new catalytic converter was cut off, they ripped out the door lock (instead of unzipping or cutting through the soft top), they sheared through the security console, broke the steering column and ripped out the ignition - after cramming a screwdriver into all of the external locks, permanently fucking them all up. Everything inside was stolen, except for my tent rainfly, which wasn't a whole lot but it still adds to the indignation. I had to buy a complete set of wheels and tires just to drive it out of impound, and wasted several hundred more dollars paying for the tow and impound fees. Also, I'd recently removed full coverage since the Jeep was just sitting around as a leisure vehicle and I hadn't driven it much in the last year or so. So, I get to eat the several thousand dollar cost for the theft. Also, most of the cops I had to deal with were really condescending.

She looks at her watch and says ""You're on in ten, hurry up."" The realization hits me that I'm expected to be on stage in front of an audience in ten minutes. I hustle to my music locker and grab my flute and music folder (I played flute all through school, and still do). I'm thinking the entire time: ""what pieces are we playing?"" I look through the folder and there are at least 40 pieces of random paper falling out. Books, pamphlets, and graded tests are shoved in there; seemingly everything but music.

Now, anxiety hits me that I can't find the music, and I don't even know what pieces they are. The other two girls I'm to perform with walk out onto the stage in front of the crowd (indiscriminate people), and set up. They're waiting for me…. I don't know what to do. I sit in my chair on the stage, knowing that everyone in the crowd is waiting for us to start….but I can't perform. I don't have any idea why I'm there or what I'm supposed to be doing. Everyone stares at me as I panic.
