TITLE: My [M20] girlfriend [F17] of 3 months wants to end things. Never brought up issues before.
POST: So this girl I have liked for a long time and I started dating 3 months ago. We were good friends before that and I suppose you could say that we had chemistry. We only see each other once a week due to school, but things seemed good at the beginning. After a while, it started to become awkward. The last few times we've hung out it has been difficult to keep a conversation going and when we do talk it feels forced (keep in mind that we had no trouble at all with this as friends and during the beginning of our relationship). For me, I believe this is because I have been locking my self in more and more as our relationship progressed, due to some insecurities I've had in the past and being self conscious about them. 

Neither of us brought this up until she told me the other day that she thinks we should take a break. She expressed how it feels like the chemistry is gone, and when their is no emotional or physical aspect to our relationship (I'm pretty flexible with the physical side of things, but it's never been a priority for me since I figured when the time is right that will come naturally) that there isn't really anything there. The problem I have is that instead of bringing up the issue and trying to work on those issues together, she just want to immediately take a break. I understand that there are issues, and that since neither of us has brought them up until now that we are really lacking in our communication. I realize that we need to be more open with each other to get that chemistry back, I just feel as though it's something that we should work on rather than immediately moving on with.

TITLE: Reddit, how do I stop dumb teens from doing lousy things to my driveway/house?
POST: Anyway, there are these teenagers who live down the block.  These teens used to be ""friends"" with my brother until early this summer. 

One night, these kids wrecked all the flowers in my backyard. Thus, my brother (14) confronted and stopped hanging out with these kids. 

Since then, they've been annoying the family.  They've been pouring salt to the back of our cars (as-salt-ing? ..no?), playing ding dong ditch, and leaving trash around the yard.  I'm almost positive that the same kids who used to hang with my brother are the offenders.  When they come over and ask for my brother and my brother refuses to see them, the next day I see stupid crap like this in the yard.
I know the things they do are insignificant, but it really does get annoying after their sad attempts. 

What can I do to make them stop these shenanigans?

Here's the catch; I don't want to confront their parents, mainly because they're okay with their children's behavior.

TITLE: My siblings (36F|39M) won't let me (28F) pay them back for things.
POST: We recently went on a family vacation, and we (me and my siblings) agreed to foot the bill for our parents, but split equally among us three.

However, my siblings both seemingly don't want the full amount from me. They say things like, ""Oh, forget about it"", or ""You can just pay for ______ while I pay for ______."" If we were to do it this way, our individual contributions would be roughly proportional to our household incomes.

Yet I feel uneasy about this. On the one hand, I do make the least money and it's kind of great to not have to pay as much (I'm pretty frugal and wouldn't have chosen the more expensive accommodation options).

On the other hand, I feel like my siblings' spouses don't particularly like me, or even see me as a mooch. I've always been the baby of the family due to being significantly younger. I also feel like I haven't balanced my debts, like I will still owe them something, or that my brother-in-law or sister-in-law will grumble, ""Why are you still paying for OP's portion for ________""?

They sometimes pick up other small things, like lunches and dinners, that I have done with less frequency, because we have family things at their houses most of the time.

If I try to insist to pay them, they get kind of angry. What should I do? What's fair?

TITLE: [Help] Older dog has peripheral vestibular disease.
POST: In October of last year my older dog, about age 15, had an episode where he lost most of his balance control. He kept falling over and couldn't keep food or water down. We took him into the vet and they diagnosed him with peripheral vestibular disease, also called old dog syndrome. They gave him some some meds for nausea, basically Dramamine, and told us that he most likely would never bounce back to his old self.

I have continued giving him Dramamine since then to help with his balance and coordination. He has lost 10 pounds since October due to him not wanting to eat as much. Some days he tries to play but usually ends up falling over some due to his coordination issues. He also has went deaf and has trouble seeing. I've felt up until recently that he has mostly good days, and some bad days.

A couple weeks ago, I took him back to the vet for a checkup and the vet did some blood work. He is pretty healthy as far as blood work is concerned and no spots on his x-rays. The vet prescribed him steroids, which I don't think have helped at all. At this point I'm just starting to feel like he isn't happy. He sleeps most of the time and barely eats, except for his treats.

With all this, I just keep wondering if I'm doing the right thing keeping him around not knowing if he is in pain. I know he isn't going to get better and it's just down hill from here. I also feel like I'm giving up on him if I put him to sleep at this stage. I know if he gets to the point that he can't get up, stops eating completely, or worse, that it's time. This gray area that he is in now is so frustrating and stressful. Any advice? Thanks.

She then asks me to come over to her apartment because ""she's been listening to people all day and she NEEDS me there"". When I say I'm tired and in bed she starts crying. I don't know what to do. Today I got home from work at 1am, and she asked me to come over. I said I was tired and sore (I'll have to bike over to her apartment because I can't park there over night). She then starts crying how she doesn't have anybody and how she needs me there and how if I really cared, I would've been there today. I told her that besides class and work, I had ~10 minutes of free time today. She promptly tells me ""if you cared you would've seen me during that 10 minutes"". I feel like an asshole because I really want to help and I love her more than anything, but I feel like these students are affecting her life more than they should, and are in turn affecting my life and sleeping schedule. Every time I bring up the fact that I need sleep, she will say ""you think I don't need sleep? I've slept less than you for the past month"". I don't know how to respond to that. I didn't make her choose the RA job..

TITLE: Me [23 M] with my GF [21 F] of 3 years, how can I deal with my feelings of wanting her to dress differently?
POST: All women dress how they want. They shouldn't feel societies pressures to conform and any man should appreciate it. They are individuals and should be allowed to wear functional comfortable clothes.

That's what I know. That's what my mind gets focused on. And then, I get hung up with my girlfriend's choice of no makeup/not nice clothes.
I really struggle with thoughts of wishing my girlfriend wore different things. I really enjoy things like eyeshadow and mascara, and I really enjoy things like skirts and leggings and high heels. But that's not who my girlfriend is, and never will be. She likes dressing in loose clothing, and I should be fine with that.

It is just SO HARD to handle that fact that rationally I know I want her to wear what SHE wants, but at the same time, I want her to wear seductive impractical clothes for me.

I've talked to her about it. She doesn't see why I'd want her to wear those clothes at risk of attracting people other than me. For instance, for halloween, why would she want to wear a slutty costume ""to get all the attention in the room"". I asked if she would wear those things for just me, for when we go on dates or at home together, and she said ""maybe someday [like after we are married]""... If we get married. I always get to our dates and feel a little disappointed that she just wears the most casual clothes appropriate for the occasion.

Am I right to be hung up on this? Is this who I am, and I will always be vaguely and inexplicably unsatisfied? Or should I just try to ignore these thoughts and enjoy my independent, confident, intelligent, and beautiful girlfriend?

Me and my roommate both have guarantors and since they are considered applicants as well the total application fee we paid was $400. We were kept waiting to hear back if we were approved for a week. When we contacted the management office they continued to tell us everything was in order and our application looked great. Eventually after a week we were told that the unit had been taken and basically given to a ""stronger applicant"". When asked if our application was denied/rejected the broker said no and that the application fee can be put towards another unit but cannot be refunded as a credit check had been performed and our paperwork had be ""processed"" towards the afore mentioned unit. I am currently enrolled for credit monitoring services with both my bank (which monitors all three major credit bureaus) and Equifax. I noted that an inquiry was NOT made in the entire month of June on their behalf.

Me and my roommate went on to apply for another apartment for which we received approval within an hour after turning in our guarantors and our paperwork and a notice of credit inquiry a day after the application was submitted. However, in the process of turning in paperwork for this subsequent apartment we were asked to submit a CPA letter and letter of employment which the initial broker/management company DID NOT request and supposedly ""processed"" our application without. 

Last but not least the second broker we worked with offered us a New York state broker disclosure form - ( That he said was required of brokers to clarify that they were working for the tenants/renters and not the building management/owner. This was never offered by the initial Broker.

TITLE: Thinking about switching majors... again.
POST: Hi guys and girls, I'm looking for some advice. When I was a freshman, I started college as a Biology major. I didn't have a plan but it sounded like a good place to start. After having to withdraw from my math class and then barely passing the second time around, plus barely getting C's in my core classes,  I decided to switch to English. It was an obvious choice because of all the extra English classes I was taking an acing. I do know the risks and challenges of switching to such a limiting major. I'm now a junior and have been looking at graduate schools for Library Science for a year now. However, the more I think about it, the more I wish I would have switched to Psychology. I've been thinking about having a Psychology minor but I love it so much that it's starting to bother me that I'll be only minoring in it. I really enjoy it, I'm good at it, and there are many more employment opportunities that actually utilize the major. I'm not looking for criticism for my decisions. I'm looking for useful advice, anecdotal evidence that I should or shouldn't switch again, and maybe a little reassurance that I'm not the only one feeling this way. I'll be talking to my adviser later this week and then doing some academic counseling. Thanks for reading.

TITLE: My Girlfriend's (f18) Officially a Model Now, and I'm (m18) Uncomfortable With It
POST: Hello Reddit people! This is my first post ever, so I don't know if I'm formatting this correctly or anything, so please bear with me. :P

Now that we have that out of the way...

So, my girlfriend and I have been together for a little over 8 months, and she just got a modeling job for a magazine or store or something. And this girl is absolutely beautiful, 10/10 babe with large breasts and the most amazing curves I've ever seen on a girl. Just a couple of hours ago, she messaged me about how she was going to be modelling for them regularly, including swimsuits during the July photoshoots.

Now, I really, REALLY don't want to be a possessive or greedy boyfriend, but this just, well, makes me uncomfortable. Hundreds if not thousands of people are going to see my girlfriend in barely any clothing, and I know for a fact that the male models are a dozen times as attractive as I'll ever be. Plus, well, we all know there's those people who take these magazines home, and... do stuff.

So, how should I deal with this? Should I tell her up front that I'm not comfortable with it? She's really flirty, and I have no idea what the culture is in the modelling industry, so I don't know if she'll end up leaving me for some hotter guy than me (I'm not exactly an Adonis), or that her body's basically being exposed to the world. That kind of bothers me because guys (or girls) don't exactly go into a relationship with the understanding that nationwide people are going to see your girl (or boy)friend's nearly naked body on a regular basis. But on the other hand, I don't want to be controlling, and I want her to be happy, so maybe I should just forget about the whole thing. Am I overreacting?

TITLE: Girlfriend [20 F] has a friend [19 M] staying over at her house, and this friend tried sleeping with her before.
POST: Me (21 M) and my girlfriend (20 F) have been dating for 3 months now, and she was a virgin until I met her. Things were going great between us.  

One of her friends (20 F) from Montreal is staying over at her place for the holidays, which I am cool with, until my girlfriend said that her brother (19 M) was coming too.  

Now here is where the story gets interesting. About a year and a half ago, that brother tried to sleep with my girlfriend (single at the time) when they were drunk one time, but my girlfriend refused. I asked her if she is cool with him staying over, and she said ""yeah, we are basically cousins. Our parents were friends before we were born and we've known each other for as long as I can remember.""  

My girlfriend told me about this incident a week after this brother was staying over at her house, and she was even thinking of not ever telling me this story. That worried me a lot. I felt that she should have told me about this incident right away, and I think that this brother still has feelings for my girlfriend. Like she said they are basically cousins, so why would he even try to sleep with her in the first place. That also bugged me.  

So I got really upset when she told me this story and I am very worried that she will cheat on me, or that he will try something again. They are sleeping in the same house for 2 weeks for fucks sake. Even though she says nothing will happen, I can never be too sure. I trust my girlfriend, but I dont trust that brother.  

So guys, I dont know what to do. I dont even know if I should be doing anything. I am really worried and I have this weird bad feeling in my stomach now and I know its because of this.  

Any advice or anything to say to me would be very helpful. Thanks

TITLE: She's (F21) my (M23) ex but one of my closest friends. How do I deal with this?
POST: My ex (F21) and I (M24) dated for a little over a year before she decided to call it quits. She cited feeling unappreciated and I didn't fight it, basically because I assumed she had already moved on, and didn't want to beg. One week later, she called back and said she thinks she made a mistake and wanted to try again. That only lasted a week. This was understandable, however, cause we tried to pick up where we left off and didn't address any of the underlying issues. And so, nothing much changed and it was painfully obvious that the first breakup had left somewhat of a rift between us. For me, the fact that she had made the choice to break up before communicating with me her concerns, made me think why wouldn't she do this again? Whether it's later on when we're dating or if we happened to get married? For her, the fact that I didn't fight for the relationship bothered her and made her question if I even wanted to be together. 

2 months later, she contacts me saying she realizes she's made a mistake. I'm not over her. However, I would be a fool to go back to her. The trust is  no longer there and I don't think she would be able to handle the fact that most of my friends now disapprove of her after all that has happened.

I still like her, but I think I'm doing the mature thing by not going back to her. We broke up on good terms, but obviously we both need time away from each other.

TITLE: Me [27f] don't know how to respond to my ? [32m] blowing hot and cold.
POST: What is going on this guys head?

Me and potential bf are currently long distance, but we have met in RL before but we were just friends back then. We have been in contact every single day through text, calls and Facebook. He always sends me a good morning message as well as wishing me good night too. We talk about everyday life stuff, personal stuff and for the last month there's been lots of flirting and the occasional sexting session.

I have asked him what 'we' are and he has said that he really likes me and can see this going somewhere and he wants to meet up again when he comes to live near me in a few months.

He told me he has difficulty trusting a woman when she shows interest in him because he had a long term emotionally abusive relationship a few years ago where she basically faked the whole thing to get his money and destroyed him emotionally in the process. I told him, I understand and I am happy to let him take the lead so it's at a comfortable pace.

But he blows hot and cold all the time and it's so frustrating.  He'll act like a boyfriend one minute and get very platonic. He'll text me all day and phone me then I'll barely hear from him at all apart from maybe a checking in text. He'll open up to me about something and then completely close off for a few days.

When he lets go and acts himself and not so 'in his head', he is an amazing guy and it's that that makes me wan to pursue something with him.

My question is, how do I respond to this? I've just been remaining consistent and not chasing when he pulls away, but being happy to speak to him when he returns. It just makes me confused as to whether he actually is serious about this turning into something and he's just 'rubber banding' or if he is just playing with me.

TITLE: I can't let go of someone I can't be with,it's driving me insane.
POST: So,I (20F) met him (25M) few weeks ago while he was visting my hometown. We met in a club,danced a bit and then left and spent the rest of the night talking to each other until dawn. He gave me his phone number and his e-mail address and told me to contact him if I want so I did.

I texted him a day after that and he asked me if I was willing to show him around town and help him find presents for his family. We spent the entire day together walking around the city and later that same day, we met again to go out and have fun. This was our last night together because he had to leave back to France next morning...after he left we talked to each other every day via email in which he wrote that he misses me and how he wants to be here.

The thing is that we get along very well and are very comfortable with each other. We were together for 3 days and had a lot of fun and gotten to know each other as much as you can get to know someone in 3 days...I miss him a lot,I met many people after he went back but no one seems to be interesting and I'm not attracted to anyone else at all. I know it's a long shot and that I shouldn't waste my time on something that it's not going to happen but I really can't get him out of my mind. I really do understand that it was just some kind of summer thing but we connected very fast and now I can't stop thinking about it. If someone has a similar story please share and tell me what happened and how did you take it?

TITLE: Me [20 M] with my GF [23 F] of 1.5 years, I'm trying to change but my GF is on her last straw with me.
POST: So I've been seeing this girl ever since i was 18 and she was 22, she's is perfect in every single way imaginable shes smart, shes good looking, good with family,etc etc. 

This is the first relationship I've ever been in and to be honest i didn't know what the hell i was doing. In short I would do stupid shit like bring up stuff from our past (when she was distrustful to me, she is very trustful now) and it would end up like making us both sad (ya i know im an idiot).

More about me and her, I live with my parents and I'm still in 3rd year of University and she has already graduated and lives by herself and has a stable job (which stresses her out all the time). 

As of last week, she came out and said that it might be better for us to breakup and I begged and pleaded that she give me another chance to see that I can change (which she did). 

That conversation was a serious wake up call I've been changing my attitude and I'm becoming overall a nicer person (I believe). We had a intense conversation yesterday where she aired her fears and concerns, she mentioned that it's to big of her to ask me to change my personality  for her , and shes afraid I would hurt her by reverting to my old ways (emotionally, I've never physically hurt her ever). For the record, I would go through this change regardless if I was with her or not for the better of me.

What can I do to save this relationship with this girl that I love so much, and when I say I'm changing I'm really changing and I've told her that. 

A couple months before I met her I lost 40 pounds in two months with exercise and healthy eating and I've stuck to it I have more determination than anyone, when I make a goal I always put 100% of my effort to reaching it.

TITLE: Any experience with Feliway?
POST: My poor cat (~1yr old calico) has problems peeing--it might be crystals.  I'm currently working with a vet and changing her diet etc.    One thing that was suggested was Feliway.   

The Vet said that she might not be getting enough water.  This cat drinks more water than any cat I've ever seen, and I was giving her wet food twice a day as well.  Before she was having problems urinating she'd PEE SO MUCH!  Like massive clumps of urine that she'd play with if I didn't scoop them straight away (my kitten is a dirtball).    I'm wondering if maybe she misses me and is drinking less when I'm not around and I'm not really noticing it.  If this is the case I want to try Feliway.  (My mom, a vet tech recommends it as well).  

For my cat's first 7 months with me (she followed me home off the street) I was working from home, this month, I started working a ""real"" job and am away for 9 hours.  I do make an effort to play with her a bit when I get home, but she's such a cuddle bug that we wind up just cuddling and watching TV.   

It's hard to tell if she is stressed with me leaving, because she is SUCH A CHILL LITTLE GIRL.  She's playful at the right times, cuddly when I want her to be, and she's so good at the vet--only slightly ""normal"" nervous.  
I'm not having issues with her peeing outside the box; I just want to make her less stressed.  

Sorry, on with the questions,  have you guys used Feliway?  Where do I plug it in?   My apartment is the first floor of a row home and she's allowed everywhere.

TITLE: I [18 M] have been talking to [18 F] in my class. We do a quick conversation but don't talk much after. I'm also interested in asking her out but not sure how to go with that
POST: Hopefully this doesn't become too long

So the girl i sit next to we generally just say simple things and actions but it just stops soon.  

An example is she'll look up me walking to my seat, she smiles at me, I smile at her.  I say something like ""Whats up"" and she'll say something pretty bland like ""nothing much, you?"" Then I said ""Ah, I just took two tests, so pretty tired and dead beat"" then it just kinda stops there

I just assumed she doesn't like me so she doesn't want to talk much but half the time she starts the conversation with me. But sometimes (like today) we just didn't say anything to each other.  She also was homeschooled so maybe she doesn't know how to converse either?  I dunno

  Also, I don't know if this matters but this professor is really weird and had us have assigned seats.  So we had two weeks of preparation for us to have our permanent seats, both of us haven't moved out seats and are now just sitting next to eachother

Ever since I was a kid I've been really shy/awkward especially too women (i've never dated) so I guess I'm just not sure how to keep the conversation going.  She's also generally one of the people in our class to be in class discussions but I'm generally not, maybe I should also start bringing my self in?

TITLE: I need advice with the corner I feel like my wife is backing me into
POST: My wife and I have been married for a little over a year and we've been together for about 6 years. In the past two years, I've gotten a much better job, worked my ass off, been promoted, and we've been able to enhance our lifestyle as a result. My wife has in the last two years worked a dead end job that she claims to hate. She was recently promoted (big promotion) so we got her the new car she wanted. Now she wants to go back to school.

Because she's unhappy with her career, she wants to go back to school to get a masters degree. Ultimately she wants to be a city planner or a city manager. However, in order for her to do this, we have to make some changes in our lifestyle. Things like: live in a much cheaper place, sell things we don't need to drum of some cash, start biking/public trans, etc. Tonight she asked me if I'd consider selling my car (she can't/won't learn to drive stick) and cut back on our expenses so she can do this. I don't really want to budge on this and here's why:

She isn't going to make more money. In my mind, if spending all this money on a better degree doesn't net you anything (aside from maybe greater job satisfaction), it's not worth it. We can't afford to have a family now, so things aren't going to get any better.

I don't want to sell my car. I've been working my ass off to get where I am and I don't want to compromise on something that I really love (driving) so that we can afford to have her go back to school.

She occasionally says things like ""I want to run a bed and breakfast"" which makes me feel like she doesn't know what she wants to do and this will just lead to more dissatisfaction.

I brought up the financials and she got pissed off because she felt I was being selfish because I was focusing on the money. It quickly escalated into a yelling/pissing contest and got us no where.

Basically, I'm lost. I don't know what to do or how to handle this situation. Please help.

POST: Hey everyone!

Last summer, I buddied up with her because she looked like she needed friends, but now that I'm interested, it's weird.  The group is also awkward, with lots of gossip.  I'm the only single guy who will directly go up to girls or try to talk to everyone.

She gives lots of negative signs when I talk to her.  Sometimes she starts out excited to talk and then shies away, but she usually gives a quick response and leaves.  **I tried texting a couple times, but she responded immediately with short, conversation-killing messages.**  This week, I invited her to a small group thing (us + another couple she's comfortable with + maybe more from the group) and she just said, ""I can't, sorry."" and left.  There's more, but it's all like this.

**However, she told me that she could be extroverted with close friends, but took forever to open up to people due to horrible social anxiety.**  She positions herself in ""talking range"" of me and watches me a lot, in an increasingly jumpy way.  If I say something in a group or take my phone out, she'll jump, look at me, and then quickly stare off into space.  Sometimes if I go up to people near her and her girlfriends, as soon as I arrive, she'll turn and step out towards me, and then snap back.

I have more examples, but they're similar.  How can I get to know her better?  Is she even interested?

Thanks!

TITLE: TIFU because I had a boogie
POST: Happen last night. I just drop this wonderful beautiful girl at home, but I must confess what happen during dinner. We were having a great time. Laughing and playing around. She was just as immature as I am. We were telling stupid jokes and all and when the waiter came by to delivery our food she mention the he looks like a gyarados from pokemon and I lost it. 

Now for the record I just got over a cold and my nose was a bit stuffy and I took some cold medicine which in turn dried my nose up. I felt the boogers were loose but I didn't blow my nose like a normal human being. With that said that hard laughter became my down fall. I felt this booger leave my nose and hit her French onion soup. The terror I felt when I saw the splash. The horror when I notice she didn't see it. The relief that I was in the cool. The panic of telling her what just happened. The disgust I felt when I watched her eat the soup. The fuck I gave afterwards because I cannot tell her what happened. I pretended nothing happen and continue our date. 

At the end of the night she wanted a kiss. I told her I still felt the affects of my cold and said we will kick it another time. 

I will not be calling her again. Woe is me.

TITLE: I [19 M] with my Girlfriend [19 F] of almost 2 years, are having issues regarding sex and anxiety
POST: Please help, GF and I are having some issues regarding sex and anxiety 

I have been with my girlfriend for almost 2 years, the sex was always great and even sometimes on the kinky side which was awesome! 
But in the last few months things have changed, we barely have sex any more and if I initiate she only wants to take care of me.
Some of the main issues are she is on the pill and feels that it is hurting her sex drive and ability to get wet, we are both university students so we are busy and we don't live together. The biggest problem she has expressed is that it started to hurt, this pain has led to her becoming very anxious about sex, even the thought of sex can put her on edge.
 Also we both feel we have become bored and want to spice things up. I want to satisfy her again. 
I really need some help, ideas, pointers, any thing?
We love each other very much and see this as only a bump in the road. But we both want to fix it. 
Thank you!!!

TITLE: Me [21F] with boyfriend [22M] 9 months, am I wrong to be upset?
POST: Sorry if this sounds pathetic, I just wanted a bit of perspective before I overreact and cause an argument.

Basically, for the past 5 months I have lived around an hour away from my boyfriend (before that we were living in the same city). We see each other every weekend, with me traveling down to see him more often than the other way round. I'm fine with this, he lives in a nicer city and I get to visit friends.

He is in a band and has been since a year or so before we got together, it makes him really happy and that's cool. They often play gigs and I'll normally go along and watch. 

For my 21st birthday, my parents said they will pay for me and him to go on holiday (this was in October). I've been waiting for him to give me dates that we can go, hopefully around March time, so I can book it and get time off work. He has come up with tonnes of dates that he is doing band stuff and still no solid date that we can go anywhere. I also asked if we could put a bit of extra money towards what my parents offered so we could go somewhere nicer, and he said he can't afford it which is fine.

This brings me to my problem: he just dropped it on me that he is going to be paying £600 to record some songs with his band in March time. I'm pretty upset by this, as it seems that the band is clearly his priority and that he can't be bothered with this holiday. The only other issue I've really had is that he didn't get me a birthday present and I know that I can be difficult to choose things for and he didn't have much money at the time so I let it go.

Am I wrong to be upset? I don't want him to stop being in a band because it makes him really happy and I enjoy going to see them play, but it seems a bit worrying that he can drop this much money on something when he 'has no money' etc.

Sorry for the tonne of text!

TITLE: I [18M] am into a girl [18F] who I just found out (from her) that has a history of cheating.
POST: So, for the past few months I have been talking to, and now, flirting with this one girl. We became really close friends and things were looking as if at any moment we could enter a relationship. However, a few days ago we had a very deep conversation about personal flaws and mistakes we have made in the past. That was the moment that I learned about how she has cheated on other guys before.

According to her, the first person she dated was abusive and overall horrible to her, so she cheated on him when she was an environment where he wasn't present, and subsequently their relationship ended. But, this was not an isolated incident. She also told me that when with her next SO, she cheated on him with two entirely separate guys, both whom were dating someone else at the time. 

My only response when I heard all this information was ""why?"" to which she replied ""because I'm a horny mess and can't control myself"".

There are so many red flags here it's actually unbelievable. It's like some kind of crazy red flag fiesta.

Despite all of that, she told me that she regrets her having cheated and realizes how awful and fucked up her actions were. Most importantly she said that she is determined to change and is actively working on improving herself and not making the same past mistakes and decisions.

On top of all that, this is a person with whom I'm more comfortable than with anyone else and I value as a friend above all else. 

I honestly don't know what to do.

I'm not that bothered about not going myself as I've never been a fan of large social atmospheres but my SO (as most typical teenage girls) is really excited to go. She's fully supportive of me, told me that she understands and that she'd go with the girls, but I can tell she's upset about it and is getting a tinge of jealousy when she sees her friends getting ""promposals.""

When we met we immediately hit off. We like the same things and have similar personalities to a point that is crazy. We are so alike and he understands me completely even if I say so little. He is the definition of the one for me, Physically and mentally. We have known each other for quite some time now and I met his SO around the first time I met him. After that I haven't seen her often. 

The tension around us is so present, flirting is just something that gradually developed. We spoke about our feeling ( that we are so similar and get along so well) and it is on both sides said that it is extraordinairy. We kissed a while ago (while being drunk, this is not an excuse, just for your interest) and it left me confused. We planned to talk about it but it hasn't happened yet. We did, though, kiss again (drunk again) and drunkenly talked about our feelings for each other. He said he loved me but because of the age difference he couldn't chose for me, eventhough he doubts his current relationship and says his gf doesn't make him feel good at all and I do make him feel good and loved. At this point I have fallen in love with him and struggle with my feelings and his betrayal towards his gf ( whom, in my opinion is a controlling bitch who doesn't let him live his life. She checks on him every second and is mad for no valid reasons. I am not the only one who thinks this and this opinion was formed before we kissed the first time). We do plan to talk but it's difficult since there is always someone else around. I am lost. What am I to do?

I've known her for 3 years and she has been treated like shit by her 2 other boyfriends in the past, I should also mention that she is on heavy anti anxiety meds and has depression (this will seems like an important detail)

Anyway hear is why i'm asking this - everything was just perfect until about 3 weeks ago, at first the contact was constant, we would text everyday and with time it became more rational and we'ed text a bit through the week before we saw each other. This all stopped after one date where she told me the L word for the first time - one week no contact, and when i texted she replied 1 week later. The thing is, we still saw each other on a date, and she was affectionate and all, but then BAM she goes cold on me by text again but a week and a half latter we see each other again and it's all normal in person again.

I have confronted her about this, asked if everything was ok but she gave me very vague answers like ""I'm the kind of person who needs to think about there problems before asking for others people's oppinions"" and ""You can talk about anything with me"" (In my head I was like : wtf, you never answer your phone and text when the planets are aligned) 

I should also add that I left the country for a month and a half 4 days ago (maybe that has somthing to do with her distance? but shouldn't it be the opposit?)

FF 2.5 years of staying in touch and having a great time that ends in passionate kissing almost every time we hang out, despite having moved several states away. We get together. Relationship is great. Really great for about 2 years. 

We had moved in together. We started having really bad money issues when a lot of career things didn't really work out. Over the course of the next 1.5 years, we both had to drop out of school to start working jobs we didn't love. We also attempted an open relationship that was ridden with jealousy. Things got tense and bad and sad and sometimes volatile. We broke up. 

7 months ago he moved out of our shared apartment. I've thrown myself into hobbies, the gym, friends: all of the things. My friends tell me I'm doing great--I'm passionate and gorgeous and all of these great things. I've been going on dates.

BUT. I think about him all the time. I miss him all the time. Things happen in my life and I want to share them with him. I can't seem to truly believe in connecting to any of the people I've been on dates with. 7 months seems like a long time. Am I rushing myself?

POST: I dont know what to say here, except that I was finally happy. I thought this was it, we weren't like totally on fire or in sync, but it was pretty damn close.

Saw him often, the chemistry was insane. And then all of a sudden last weekend he tells me he has an interview in a different city. I know he hated our current city, its too big, too loud, too crowded and people arent friendly. I have been here for a really long time and I love the energy, ruthless or otherwise.

I told him to give it some time, we just met, let me help him like this city as I do. He told me he is confused and needs time to think things out, he likes me but is not happy here.

And then I just got one message from him after his interview. Its been 5 days but who is counting. We never talked about being exclusive. So I bit the bullet and went on a date last nite. All it did was reaffirm how much I missed and liked this guy over a short period.

I messaged him and called him. No reply yet, I dont know if its a lost cause. I miss him and I cant bring myself to start dating anew. Why isnt meeting someone you instantly click with the end of it all?

POST: I'm so sorry I know this isn't really the place to post this, and if someone could let me know a better sub, I'll move it there. I just feel like I can't get over my bf and just hit a breaking point tonight. Basically we broke up because of distance and we both left on the terms that we still love each other and should ultimately get back together. That was about three weeks ago. We also had a deal not to talk to each other for 3 weeks, so I recently messaged him when the time was done. The thing is, when he messaged back, I realized that there was no way I could message him back as if I was normal. I don't know why, but for me this was kind of a breaking point. I guess it finally sunk in that we really broke up. Now I don't know how I should play it, should I message him back as if I'm trying have a conversation with him, or give a really short answer to cut him off? Or I guess just tell him the truth? I'm really leaning towards the last, but I don't want to come off pathetic.

Additions info: what really just pushed me over the edge was that I just had an orientation with all the people in the program I joined where I live abroad, and all the guys were such major creeps and were so gross to me. It was so demoralizing and made me realize how much I gave up in my bf. All I want is to be with him, but I know that's impossible while I'm here. I'm just so tired of all of this.

TITLE: Me [17 M] with my (ex?)girlfriend [17 F] 2.5-5 months, cheating or sexual harassment?
POST: I'll be short about this.

A few days ago my girlfriend called me and said she did something and that I'll want to break up with her but she couldn't tell me over the phone and had to text it to me (she sounded like she was about to cry)  We are in a long distance relationship since about 2-3 weeks ago.

She then texts me that she ""slipped"" and had done something sexual with another man.  I'll be honest our relationship was already not very healthy so it didn't really come to me as a surprise.

Naturally, I break up with her.  She doesn't want to accept that we are broken up.  She calls me and keeps asking for a second chance saying that she regrets it and it was a mistake.  I am adamant about staying broken up though she is crying and refusing it.

A few hours later she texts me that it was out of her control.  I ask how that's possible if she gave consent and she says she didn't.  So the situation is now very complicated.  

After hearing this I sort of ""un-broke up"" with her and instead switched to a ""break"".  This is kinda arbitrary but whatever.  Anyway I just don't know what to do now.  I don't know what to believe.  Even if she is now telling the complete truth I don't think I would want to go back to a relationship though I would feel a sort of responsibility to.

I don't know if I gave enough here for you to form an opinion but you may as well try.  You can go and look at my last post if you want more information.  You'll probably call me an idiot for not breaking up earlier honestly but that's ok.

I've had so many people tell me that it gets easier, it'll get better, I will be okay but I wake up everyday and nothing, it doesn't hurt any less. The pain hasn't dulled in the slightest. It feels like everyday is worse than the last when I've heard it's supposed to be better with each passing day. 

All I can think of was I never planned for this. We talked about adopting a child or two.

All I have these days is my job and every single person there treats me like a fragile toy or something.

POST: Not a throwaway account cause I'm not super embarassed.

 

Obligatory ""this didn't happen today"" but yesterday my buddy was hyping up this big ""Fight of the Century"" thing that was supposed to be going down. Like any good friend, I figured I'd front the bill on the channel and he could just pay me back for it later.
 
 

We must have got the wrong channel though! Don't get me wrong, even though my friend got super depressed I thought it was pretty cool watching some guy run a Nascar-styled marathon, going lap for lap in what had to be the smallest track I've ever seen. They even had to put up ropes to keep the guy in the ring as he raced around! Must have not been enough excitement for regulars though, because believe it or not there was also another guy who just kind of kept punching the runner. To his credit the runner just kept blocking and running - I mean occasionally he threw a punch because who wouldn't ya know? - until he had completed so many laps I'd lost count. I did find it silly that they had to have judges at the end to declare him the winner though, I mean, he **was** the only one running the marathon...

 

Anyway! Seems my bud didn't find this as cool as I did, since he just sat there with a look of disappointment and kept shaking his head. I'm thinking next time I will have to be way more careful buying stuff on the TV... I doubt my bud is going to pay me back after such a screwup.

When i ask why, the response is with unsure answers and ends by saying it'll 'make her a better person' and she'll find out why when she does it. Naturally I cant make sense of her choice from the response she gives me.

I understand there is much more to a relationship than just sex, and breaking up with her is the last thing i would want to do. It's something I don't think I will do regardless of her decisions. However, I value sex as really important to me and our relationship. Therefore the thought of no sex for a whole year upsets me. The thought of a loved one taking away something I can only enjoy with her definitely hurts me more. I'd like to call it a selfish act but it's not something being done out of spite, but just for a reason I don't quite understand. 

Any input or reasoning behind this choice would be greatly appreciated

TITLE: TIFU by causing a car accident, then not taking responsibility for it
POST: (throwaway account) Like most of these, this did not happen today. I was either in my late teens or early 20's, driving to work early in the morning. I was working crazy hours and not getting enough sleep at the time, and as you know- 

-fuck this. I'm still trying to make excuses for it, even now! Sorry, I was definitely awake and alert enough to see that my light was fucking red. Anyway, I ran a red light going ~45-50mph, thinking that the cars turning out in front of me (coming from the opposite direction) were making yielded left turns on green. But no, they had an arrow and my light was fucking red, so you probably already know what happens next. I didn't exactly t-bone him, it was more of a head-on (I'm guessing he tried to swerve back, but by then it was too late). Both cars totaled, police and ambulance show up, they start talking to him first and from me listening from a distance, I gather that he has no license, doesn't speak any English, and has no ID or anything whatsoever. So they come talk to me after getting essentially no where with him. I saw my chance to push the blame to him, and I took it like the fucking piece of shit that I am. I told the cops that my light was green and they had no reason not to believe me.

Fast forward ~30 days or so, I get a subpoena stuck to my front door. It turns out he isn't an illegal citizen, his wallet just wasn't on him at the time of the accident. He probably met with the public defender to try and fight the charge. So I show up to court, get up in front of all those people and reiterate the lie that I told the cops. I will never forget the way he looked at me when I finished. He received a jail sentence, got fined heavily and got his license taken away. When you think about it, the only reason the truth wasn't and never will be recovered is because he couldn't speak English. I still feel like shit to this day and I will never tell anyone what I did. Why couldn't I just not have been colorblind for those 2 seconds? I fucked up.

TITLE: Me [19 M] can't commit to a relationship with my [19 F]
POST: I'm 18 and have never been in a serious relationship. I have, I suppose,  a girlfriend. She's fun to talk to, we share a lot of the same interests, but she wants to turn it up a notch.

Here's the thing, I've never really been bothered with relationships. I'm quite happy keeping my own company and I really value the freedom of being independent. But I do really like this girl, and I'd like to see more of her, but I simply can't cross that threshold. I'm really worried that I'm just going to end up upsetting her because she expects more from me. 

This has happened so many times now, talking to a girl, she wants to take it further, I don't want to commit. Is this going to be me now? I like companionship, someone to share experiences with, someone to talk to and someone to cuddle with. But the relationships I see seem to be about being on call 24/7, spending all day returning texts and basically throwing a whole lot of your personal time away for smalltalk.

What am I to do here? Either I tell her I'm not interested and I maybe loose her as a friend if it upsets her or I go for it. The thing is, if I do, it could either go really nicely, or it just raises the stakes and makes things worse if I realise it isn't for me and want to get out.

I've also gotta say, for some reason, I feel that relationships are something I need to somehow keep secret or lie about to others. I get some weird mental block there. I'm generally quite reserved, and I don't know if that's got anything to do with it, but it's like the person that I love is a personal thing, and personal things should stay private. That's a shitty way to put it, but it just seems weird to me, even though everybody does it!

A psychiatrist could probably have a field day with me!

POST: I live in a small town. I will not provide the name of this town because I do have friends who are avid redditors. 

I have lived in this town for about 8 year now and as time goes on, it just gets worse and worse. My friends are starting to get involved in drugs and the ""cool"" kids who are heavily involved in drugs and alcohol are complete douchebags that take advantage of girls, they ruin their lives. 

I just recently went through a bad break up. My ex lied to me about pretty much everything. It has been a month and she has had 2 boyfriends since. I believe that I am a pretty good guy. I stick up for people, I don't do drugs and I don't drink. I've never taken advantage of anyone, and I think I'm pretty fun to hang around. Yet I get trampled on. This whole system of who gets the credit is fucked up. I get bullied and made fun of because I do things that are right. I stand up for people who do right, and I criticize people when they do wrong.

I am going into my senior year in high school and the past couple of months have been very hard for me. I am a part of National Honor Society but I nearly failed 2 classes. I've never even come close to failing before but this town is taking it's toll. 

So, to wrap this up. Does anyone else have a similar story? Or would anyone like to give their input? Anything is greatly appreciated as I just want to get out of this town as soon as possible.

I've been dating this guy for a year and a half now. He is 21 and I'm 22 (f). I love him so much and he tells me all the time that he loves me and most of the time we are pretty amazing together...

... But he wants to be alone at some stage in his life. I can understand that he doesn't want to commit to me and I don't want to either... I mean... I hope our relationship works out but it may not. It's just that it hurts so much when he tells me that he will be unhappy with his life if he doesn't spend time alone (I think he is thinking of travelling for a couple of years and living).

He says that I'm perfect but I came at the wrong time in his life. It just he seems so definite and I don't know how to react... Is this something that a lot of guys (maybe even girls too) feel and don't act on or is this something that will only end in disaster. Is there any hope at all?

I only have a HS diploma, no certifications but solid work experience, should I be expecting to be earning more at this point in my life?

POST: [As you'll notice, I'm very inexperienced in all this]

I've had an intermittent crush on this girl for quite a few years, and only recently noticed a great opportunity to start talking to her, and things have been going quite well. I even manage to stay incredibly calm and composed when with her, and that's never happened when hanging out with other girls. 

The second time we arranged to meet (wouldn't call it a date though) was at a gym, where she met (or went) with her ex. They seemed to be good old friends, but not more than that. She never introduced him to me as her ex, I just know because he has the same surname as her ex-brother-in-law she once mentioned. (Brother-in-law meaning the brother of her boyfriend) 

When the opportunity arose, I invited her to have dinner in a place nearby – if she wasn't already going out with the ex, that is. She said she was, and invited me to accompany them to dinner. She went in his car and I in mine. It was nice and almost only the two of us talked, besides, her body language and specially eye contact were much more meaningful towards me than him.

Now I don't quite know what to make of it. I know it raises a few red flags, but I intend to take my chances regardless. Is such a close relationship with exes normal? How should I interpret her willingness to have a ""triple date"" and having me meet him (or the other way around)?

And would it be alright to ask her something along the lines of ""so he's [ex-brother-in-law's name]'s brother?"" just to make sure what I'm dealing with? How should I phrase things next time to ensure we go out just the two of us without sounding rude?

TITLE: My girlfriend [21] and I [20 M] have been dating for 5 years and are trying to figure out if we can make it work with different religious beliefs.
POST: Both me and my girlfriend were raised Christian. We began our relationship five years ago, when were both fifteen. In the past couple of years, I have been moving away from my belief in Christianity and started exploring other lines of thinking.

My girlfriend's family is very serious about their belief in Christianity and, because of her upbringing, so is she. My parents are also very serious about their faith, however, my family is much more open to questioning, doubting, and exploring. 

I know that her and her family are very happy with their faith and that is not something I wish to change in them.

She has recently began to express that she doesn't know if it is possible for us to have a relationship with two different beliefs. Until now, our difference in belief has not been an issue that I can see: my moral guidelines have not changed and continue to (mostly) align with hers. I continue in things that have been dear to me throughout our relationship, such as holding a philosophy of compassion, smoking cannabis, and remaining a virgin until marriage (something I see as valuable for her sake although I do not believe it is necessary). 

I very much love my girlfriend and am, therefore, having great anxiety trying to figure out if we can continue to be compatible from my perspective, regardless of what she decides. I do not want to hinder her spiritual life, as I see the quest for truth as the most valuable thing life has to offer. I also do not want to be impeded by the difficulties of differing beliefs. 

So then, r/relationships, from your experience is it possible to live with two different beliefs in a relationship if both are willing? Can it be beneficial? Can it be detrimental? Is it worth it if you want to be with the person more than anything? Or is it too damn difficult?

Thanks for the input and, if there are other questions you have for me whose answers might be helpful, please ask.

I continue in things that have been dear to me throughout our relationship, such as holding a philosophy of compassion, smoking cannabis, and remaining a virgin until marriage (something I see as valuable for her sake although I do not believe it is necessary). 

I very much love my girlfriend and am, therefore, having great anxiety trying to figure out if we can continue to be compatible from my perspective, regardless of what she decides. I do not want to hinder her spiritual life, as I see the quest for truth as the most valuable thing life has to offer. I also do not want to be impeded by the difficulties of differing beliefs. 

So then, r/relationships, from your experience is it possible to live with two different beliefs in a relationship if both are willing? Can it be beneficial? Can it be detrimental? Is it worth it if you want to be with the person more than anything? Or is it too damn difficult?

Thanks for the input and, if there are other questions you have for me whose answers might be helpful, please ask.

TITLE: Anyone have suggestions for HIGH heels that won't kill my feet?
POST: My fiance is a full foot taller than me (I'm 5'4"" and he's 6'4"") and I hate the idea of being that short compared to him on our wedding day. I wear heels quite often and want to on the day we get married but, like any reasonable human, don't want to be completely uncomfortable. I can usually wear 4-6 inch heels for a few hours and 2-4 inch heels all day, but I'm hoping to find some 4-6 inch heels for the big day so we can be closer in height (plus it gives an incredible slimming effect when in high heels and a long dress). 

I'm willing to compromise and find super tall heels for the ceremony and switch to slightly lower more comfortable ones for the reception, but obviously they can't be too big of a difference in height because the dress will be too long. I've been looking at [these] on amazon (in gold) but don't have any other ideas.

I met this AWESOME and AMAZING girl by coincidence, and I am really starting to fall for her. We took things slow, and didn't start sexual intercourse untill 3 weeks or so passed.

Now, She wants it all the time. Which is awesome. Except she wants it too much, and I am not comfortable declining. Today we had sex 7 times, in which I 'finished' in the first 5, which meant I could barely breathe the 6th and 7th time. I asked her how much she usually has, and told her I was used to once or twice a week, but could do more. She literally gasped at this, and told me she wanted atleast once everytime we saw eachother - atleast when its appropriate. 

I don't mind this, but I've never really turned down sex before, and I need to know how to do it without hurting her feelings or make her feel inadequate. I know it's probably every guys dream, and I must admit I am quite thrilled she wants more than me - I just don't know if I can keep up.

POST: UPDATED: 

My wife has been traveling more for work the last 2 years, and frankly, our relationship has been up and down.  She's working on the east coast this week, and we live on the west coast.

We share an Apple family account, and as a result, she shares her location.  She is supposed to come home tomorrow, but had to do dinner with her work colleague this evening.  I was texting her at midnight ET/9 PT about kids/pets issues, and I checked her location.  She frequently complains about being tired, so I am little surprised to see she is not in her hotel.  I figure the dinner ran late.  About an hour later (1:30 am ET/10:30 PT), I again check her location and she's in a residential neighborhood.  I check on Google maps, and there's not a hotel around...just houses.

I called her several times (figuring maybe the Do Not Disturb function was enabled) trying to reach her, and she does not pick up.

So, here I am, seeing her location at some house in the city that she often travels to.  She was texting me not long ago.  I am not sure what to do now...

Do I wake up early and see where the phone is?  Just ask when she gets home why her phone was in a strange place?  

I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I am obviously uneasy about all this.

What's my plan of action?

TITLE: PSA: Endomorphs, ectomorphs, and mesomorphs are not real
POST: In the general weight loss and fitness community, I frequently hear these terms casually thrown around to explain one's ability to lose/gain/maintain weight at a certain rate. From my tattoo artist who is now a competitive bodybuilder to my SO when we started this journey, it has been a consistent cause of frustration for me, as these terms- as well as constitutional psychology in general- has been discredited for years.

Constitutional psychology was developed by a psychologist named William Herbert Sheldon in the 1940's. He asserted that the human body could be split up into three ""somatotypes""- the endomorph, ectomorph, and mesomorph. He wrote a book on the topic in the 50's called *Atlas of Men*. Each somatotype was characterized as representing a different temperament, level of intelligence, and overall value. It had/has foundations in racism and antisemitism. 

The three types were described as follows (from Wikipedia): 

Ectomorphic: characterized as linear, thin, fragile, lightly muscled, flat chested and delicate; described as cerebrotonic inclined to desire isolation, solitude and concealment; and being tense, anxious, restrained in posture and movement, introverted and secretive.

Mesomorphic: characterized as hard, rugged, rectangular, athletically built with well developed muscles, thick skin and good posture; described as somatotonic inclined towards physical adventure and risk taking; and being vigorous, courageous, direct and dominant.

Endomorphic: characterized as round and soft with under-developed muscles and having difficulty losing weight; described as viscerotonic enjoying food, people and affection; having slow reactions; and being disposed to complacency.

I just wanted everyone to recognize that though it would be very convenient to have this wonderful defiance of the laws of thermodynamics to excuse the inability or lack of desire to lose weight, they have long since been disproven and to use these terms is intellectually dishonest. Barring other physical disabilities, your body type does NOT determine your ability to lose or gain weight at a relatively normal pace.

TITLE: So AT&T tried to get my commit insurance fraud, how should I handle this situation?
POST: As ridiculous as that sounds I'm about 90% sure thats what happened... So a few days ago I called into AT&T about my recently stolen phone. The representative went over what was probably a usual script of trying to remedy the problem, this included the options of either extremely expensive no contract replacement phones or cheaper but fairly outdated phones(I still had my old phone and was using it at this point so buying something like that was pointless). The conversation dragged on and on about how few options there were for me and how little there could be done since I lost my phone 2 months after buying it. 
Then finally she told me she would talk to her supervisor about it. Couple minutes on hold she comes back and tells me that her supervisor told her that she could put insurance on my phone which she KNEW was already stolen so that I may claim it, which would only cost $125. At this point I was willing to try anything, and $125 for a new Galaxy S which was usually 500 outside of contract sounded good to me. So I called the insurance company told them exactly what happened, when it happened, and it didn't go through, OF COURSE it didn't, but why would an AT&T rep tell me to do such a thing, and why did her supervisor tell her to do that. 
So I called back today got on the line with another supervisor and he didn't have much to tell me other than sorry, he gave me a few more options but those included buying some where else, adding a new line just to buy another phone or doing an early activation for $200(how is that any different since most contract phones are $200 more than non-contract), I will say he allowed me to check if my old phones IMEI was in use yet which it wasn't, unfortunately.

TITLE: Looking for advice on starting my career
POST: Hey reddit, I am a 22 year old male who just moved out for the first time down to North Carolina from Illinios. I have little to no college experience, basically a semester shy of an associates. 

The first job I landed down here was with a major car rental company, (the yellow one) as a ""manager trainee"" making roughly 28k a year (32 with overtime). My background previous to this was working as a shift manager at a health club back in Illinois as well as a number of smaller customer service/sales positions in retail. 

So far I enjoy my job but it seems to have a very high turnover rate due to the ""turn and burn"" nature of the position, however this also does provide decent room for advancement. 

My ultimate goal is to land a more business to business sales positionnwith better job security than my current position, the only drawbacks being my lack of college degree and ""professional"" experience. I feel as if I can stick it out at this company for a year so and land a promotion or two, I can use it to springboard to a more stable position in a more corporate environment, perhaps with a materials distributor (electrical, shipping/recieving, even HR? etc)

My question for you all is should I follow this plan? or move back home with my parents when my year lease is up and finish my degree? So far I'm doing well with this company but I worry if I have a couple bad months or two and am let go, (a theme I've already witnessed with a couple coworkers) it would look horrible on a resume, and only serve to put me in a worse position. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I just didn't know if anyone has been in a similar position, and could offer some advice.

POST: Last night, I was texting a friend of mine and he casually mentions this girl he's friends with who, as we both see her, is very cute. I'm not exactly sure why, but he starts telling me about her and it turns out that, on interests alone, we're incredibly similar. Everything from peculiar music taste, to hobbies, to basically everything. (And her hometown is just a few hours from mine, but that's pretty mundane.) Basically, I think she's really cute and I'm sort of in awe at how similar we are based off what he's told me, because that doesn't happen to me too often.

When my friend first told me about her, he agreed he would talk to her when he was less busy, then a few minutes later joked and said I should go to Boston (where she's currently studying). He's done this like three times now, and it's to the point where I'm just thinking, ""Oh well.""

I'm not saying I deserve to talk to her, nor am I saying there's even a chance, but we both agree it seems like we're incredibly similar, and I'd love to talk with her (if she's interested, of course!). I'm getting the impression he sort of has a crush on her, so he's not willing to do anything. How can I ask him without sounding like an asshole/desperate?

POST: I've been working with this girl for 6 months now and we get along great. We don't talk or hang out outside of work, but I really enjoy spending time with her.

It is only recently that I have started thinking about her as more than a friend and I would like to get to know her more outside of work and such, but there are some issues I am worried about.

As I said, my life is not exactly in order. I got out of a relationship a year ago and at the end I had no car, lost my savings, and am now living with her step-dad(paying rent though) so that may not be such a great thing. But I have a vehicle now too at least but its not that great. 

The age thing is weird. I mean, my parents met at 18 and 28, so it happens, but it is something to consider. Her level of maturity, life experience, etc. 

That being said though, as of now I wouldn't be expecting a huge thing from it such as us building a life together, getting, married, etc.
No, I was just thinking of it as someone to get to know, go out with, and see what happens. Especially since I've only had one seriously girlfriend in my life. 

I have no idea if I would be her type or how she feels at all. I'm not in the best shape but I wouldn't say I am ugly. Who knows what her opinion is.

So am I worried about rejection? No I cant say that is what I'm worried about. I could handle that, but I wouldn't want to ruin what we do have as co-workers/friends. I wouldn't change how I treat her if she said no, but I don't know about her. 

Basically I don't know how to go about it or if it's worth it at all. Ive never had to deal with this before lol. My last and only relationship was one that lasted 7 years and just kinda happened.

POST: I don't know where to start... 

I eat lunch with some coworkers every day, 7 total: Me, Roslyn, Jack, Nicky,Robert, Beth, and Kristie. Well, *used* to eat lunch with them, until I stopped. I found their conversations to always rotate to either bitching about work or about videogames. 

Anyway, I decided to eat lunch at a local store instead of at work. One of the coworkers (and actual friends, Roslyn) joined me, which I'm fine with that, as the conversations tends to be about other things other than just work and videogames.

About a month passes and Beth asks me if she can go join me and Roslyn for lunch at the store for lunch. I'm ok with it, and so is Roslyn. We have been going about once a week to have lunch at the store now. Kristie has joined us as well...

Which leaves Jack, Nicky, and Robert at the cafeteria. I'm having problems with Nicky, as she takes it as a personal insult that she and Jack haven't been invited to the store... But that's the catch: I never invited anyone to join me. Now she decided to send me a nasty message online through work email. 

Do I confront her directly, or do I contact my supervisor about this issue? I still have the message she sent me in ky inbox.

About a month passes and Beth asks me if she can go join me and Roslyn for lunch at the store for lunch. I'm ok with it, and so is Roslyn. We have been going about once a week to have lunch at the store now. Kristie has joined us as well...

Which leaves Jack, Nicky, and Robert at the cafeteria. I'm having problems with Nicky, as she takes it as a personal insult that she and Jack haven't been invited to the store... But that's the catch: I never invited anyone to join me. Now she decided to send me a nasty message online through work email. 

Do I confront her directly, or do I contact my supervisor about this issue? I still have the message she sent me in ky inbox.
TL;DR:  I have a group of friends at work, but one of the coworkers is taking it as a personal insult that she and Jack haven't been invited to lunch at the store with the others.

TITLE: Reddit, can you identify this bug?
POST: I went camping in the BC interior last weekend, on the last day I kept feeling a prick in my leg and several times rolled up my pant leg to find it. I didnt find anything and assumed it was a small seed that has hooks on it stuck inside my pant leg, which has happened before. Fast forward 10hrs later to when I get home and take off my pants to have a shower, this bug crawls out. Not knowing if it will fly away and get lost in my house somewhere I quickly used my sock to grab it and take it outside. When I get outside it gets stuck inside my sock, it has several small barbs on its legs, which was the pricking i felt, finally get it out of my sock and put a glass over it. Now im trying to figure out what it is, in the 10 years I have been camping at the same place I have never seen it before. So Reddit, WTF is this thing?

POST: We both work together, and I consider her a good friend. The past couple of months I started to feel something for her. I really admire her. She's smart, up beat, great personality, hard working, and overall she makes me want to be a better person.

 I got her number, and we would text like crazy. And at work, we would talk about all kinds of things. It was overall fun.

 I later would ask if she wanted to go anywhere, like get coffee or something, and she would say she was busy. Then a month ago I asked if she wanted to go to the movies and she says ""sure as friends"". In a way, I felt bad, but did my best to just accept it. (hey, maybe she will get to know me better atleast).  

 So far we haven't gone, I only brought it up during her time off from school, but she seems to be always busy. 

 At the same time, it just started to feel like we're getting distant. We talk, and she no longer looks at me, texting has been one sided(where I initiate), and mostly her side is reduced to one word answers. She no longer looks for me to talk to.

 Overall, I miss my friend, I have feelings for her, and I think she might suspect that. I'm trying to let it go, and I just want to hit the reset button and bring back things to the way they were. 

 I'm hurting and I'm frustrated. I felt like I mattered and now I feel like I'm losing her and right now she's the closest friend I got.

TITLE: I'm going into my first year of university in two weeks. I've also been very antisocial the last few years. How do I make this the best year possible?
POST: Hi AskReddit!

Been lurking here for a while now, and thought I'd posit a question that's been worrying me lately.

Just a little bit of context:
I live in Sydney, Australia, and took a gap year after graduating high school (unsure if there is an equivalent of a gap year for those living in other countries, but it's basically an optional year off before university/college starts here in Oz).
Now, I intended that gap year to be a year to get some more work at my part time job and save a little cash, but due to some unforeseen circumstances (girlfriend dumping me, the tremendous power of my laziness/procrastination), the year quickly turned into me being a hermit and staying home, moping about.

Now, having grown accustomed to the life of the hermit, I'm tremendously nervous about entering university; the whole social aspect, in particular, is incredibly frightening to me.

I want to be more social, expand my knowledge/experience, be more engaging as a person, get out of the house more, and get back into the dating game.

Any tips Reddit?

My parents don't want me to date; I come home from school late after practice; as soon as I come home I start my homework which takes me the whole night to finish due to the AP courses and my lack of smart.

I don't work, and don't have a car of my own. I can't leave the house because one parent is home at all times. Also my brothers are bored pricks that don't leave me alone.

TITLE: Youtube Revenge
POST: This was during February/March of 2012.

I had previously won an online contest of $100 for a game called Starcraft 2 back in August to my PayPal. Having only spent half of my winnings, I decided to purchase Modern Warfare 3 on Steam. However, the game cost $60, instead of the usual $50 of many other games, so I was $10 short. 

I really wanted to play MW3, though. So, I googled on how to get it for cheaper, and found an old forum I used to visit. Apparently, there was a person selling the game for $25. I messaged him, and he messaged back, and a deal was negotiated. We exchanged messages for a while, as he was taking a while getting a cd-key for me. I, stupidly ""gifted"" the money instead of purchasing it as he was getting the key for me, since I was pretty new to PayPal. Then randomly, he logged off. The whole process was around two hours I believe.

Having not seen him on for a few days, I concluded that I got scammed. Whatever, I thought. It was only $25. I was surprised that a person went through such great lengths to con a mere $25. Anyways, after that, I brainstormed ways of trying to get revenge. He stupidly put his ""IGN"" as his Skype name (Program I used to message him), and it wasn't a common one either so it was incredibly simple to find all his other accounts (youtube, steam, etc). 

When I went to his Youtube channel, I came up with a master plan, and decided to use a ""dislike bot"" to dislike his videos. He seemed to be an avid Youtuber, since he uploaded around one video a week.

I managed to get 90+ dislikes on each of his videos.... He stopped posting videos as frequently after that... even though he was still active on his channel. (Latest Activity thing on Youtube)

TITLE: I'm poor and need a car, my old car is unrepairable, and I think I was swindled. Please help
POST: To start, my car has about 180k miles on it. One day it started stalling because it couldn't idle. I took it to a local mechanic who told me I needed a new exhaust system installed for $1,500. He also ran a compression test and told me the motor was great. I paid him and it did not fix the problem, the car still stalled.

I took the car to a different mechanic. They deduced that the problem was in fact the motor, and that I would basically need another motor, which would be another $2,000 that I could not afford. They discovered this using a compression test as well.

So, I'm asking for advice about what I should do. I need a car, but have about 2k total left to my name, and my income is not good, and student loans. Do I have options to actually sue the first mechanic?

Otherwise, of the $1,500 I paid, $900 was for the exhaust part. Is there any way I can make this money back? Does anyone know of any resources to help me sell parts of my car that I could put towards getting another one? Thank you.

POST: So my wife and I finally had the night to ourselves with the kid at a sleepover.  We drive to the local park for a romantic(ish) walk together.  When we get back to the car and try to exit the parking area from the main exit we find it blocked off for a ""Movie in the park"" night.  This parking lot has two entrances/exits so we drive to the other one to find it also blocked off...this time by a fire truck and some of the local firemen.  As I motion to them that I need to exit, they wave me back in the direction of the turnabout that leads to the blocked main exit.  Never mind that this would be something of a hazard, there were plenty of other people who had parked before this whole blockade had been put into place.  I nicely ask the fireman to let us out and the following was out discussion:

Me: Sir, we need to get out of the parking lot.
Fire man (FM): Use the other exit, this one is blocked off.
Me: You guys blocked the other exit off, too.
FM: (gives me a blank stare for a few seconds then calls over 3 of his fellow fire fighters).

It is a good 2 or 3 minutes for them to come to the stunning conclusion that ""Hmm, this *could* be a problem"".

Eventually they decided it was best to let us and others out to return to our homes but I think I lost the last of my faith in humanity.  I also hope they never try this approach with a burning house.

POST: We broke up on December 17, 2015.  

After the break-up, I realized just how much she meant to me.  I love her, and am still in love with her.  She's moved on (She had another guy over at her place on December 18th...)

It was tough, but I mostly got over it.  For the past 2 weeks, however, I've realized I enjoy listening to songs that remind me of her.  Songs that are related to love and such (Think Taylor Swift, 1989).  I've realized that I'm definitely not over her.  I still love her.

TITLE: Having issues at work, need advice how to handle it or if I am in the wrong
POST: I was hoping this year would start off well, started working out and tried to get in better shape.

Things did not go as planned. Working out let to severe chest pain, my doctor ran a bunch of tests and concluded its costochondritis, basically he does not know why I have pain. Pretty much told me to take pain reliever and rest it out. Pain would come and go, then one morning I could barely move my hand without flinching. So I took day off. Next day I came in to work but she told me to go home and rest after a while.

Pain gradually subsided but led way to asthma. I have not had asthma for years. Back to doctor, he gave me inhaler, was late at work. Then this week again I barely slept sunday night and told her I will be in late. I came in late around 11 and left at 5. 

So yesterday she sat me down and told me how this was performance impacting and she was giving me a soft warning for the upcoming reviews. She admitted I have not missed any timelines, but cause I am hitting all of them while taking this time I must not be working upto potential. She told me maybe I should consider using my PTO and sorting out health issues.

I do most of the complicated analysis at work. Anything complicated is thrown my way with a day or two deadlines. I understand I have been not in at work as much. But technically I just took a day off and was late here and there cause of appointments. What are my options here besides quitting. We get our bonus payout in a month.

TITLE: Would this help to end world poverty?
POST: I noticed girls posting statuses on facebook of them claiming to go to a country for an allotted time. Upon further research, I found that the enigmatic statuses were to create awareness for breast cancer. 

 I also discovered that similar status trends have happened in the past, such as naming their bra colour for breast cancer, and people changing their profile picture to their favourite cartoon to end child abuse.

Looking at the numbers, it seems to have worked. Funding for breast cancer is in the millions every year, and I asked some people if they knew about child abuse and they told me that it was a reality. Clearly the statuses worked!

Now reddit, I am asking you if we can use this technique to decimate poverty from Africa. I was thinking we should make our statuses in such a way that we mention our *favourite food* and say that we eat it on *whatever object is directly to our right*. 

In my case, ""I eat sushi on my guitar""

If we band together, we just might have enough statuses to cause an end to hunger!

TITLE: TIFU by cashing in my Club Nintendo Points
POST: This is nowhere near as bad as the awful shit that I usually see around here, but I just need to vent.

So as many of you might have known, Club Nintendo is shutting down, and everyone's scrambling to cash in their points for something worthwhile, myself included. I haven't really been using my codes up until Mario Kart 8 came out with that offer for a free Wii game if you register it. Anyway, I cashed in all of the games I could find with redeemable codes, and soon was swimming in coins.

Now, something else you might not know is that Club Nintendo has been down for about a week or more for maintenance, something that annoyed me to no end, so much so that I went straight to cashing my coins before it went under again. I remembered the games they were offering were just either some shitty eShop game or some virtual consoles that I wasn't interested in, so, without hesitation, I decided on getting that sick new Majora's Mask message bag, almost depleting my load of coins.

I guess it was the annoyance of the incredibly long maintenance period, but it never clicked in my brain that they could have added some things to the rewards shop during that time.

After placing my order, I noticed I still had a small amount of coins left, so I decided I would see if I could waste the rest of them on a virtual console or something, so I looked into the rewards. Staring back at me was The Wonderful 101, prime and ready for buying at a mere 600 coins. I have a little under 200 now.

He is the opposite. I have noticed since we started dating that I don't do these activities as much anymore because I enjoy being around him so much that I have somewhat given them up (stupid... I know). He works a lot of hours (on his feet the whole time) so I understand why he doesn't want to do these things. But it's starting to bum me out that on our days off we end up watching TV, going out to eat, or getting drinks. We are both very social/outgoing people, but he would rather go sit at a bar or try a new restaurant (which I enjoy too!) but sometimes I wanna get out and be active together. 

The last guy I was seeing (we didn't connect emotionally so it ended), loved being outdoors and staying active so I never sat on a couch. I know I can do these activities with other friends but all of my friends have now moved across states. I'm trying to connect with some people from work as of now. I know can do these things alone too, but it's such a bummer not enjoying some of my passions with my SO. I don't want to change him or his interests, and I also don't want to end it.

It's hard dealing with anxiety in a relationship, and it often makes me question whether these 'troubles' are fabricated due to my anxiety, or if they are a real problem in the relationship. Usually I can spot the real issues (that anyone outside would spot) quickly, and we sort through the issue together. We make a point to talk and talk often, but I won't deny we have had our fair share of issues.

Besides this, sometimes, I feel like the issue is deeply rooted in my anxiety. For example, sometimes I will just seemingly out of the blue wonder if this is all going to work out with him, if we will be able to get through A situation or B situation, and it spirals out of control in my head. 

Silly, seeing as when this happens, I've been given no trigger or reason to suspect anything is wrong. It happens at the worst of times too, like when things are going really well! 

I'm seeking help for my anxiety as best as I can, but I really need some advice on how to deal with this issue inside of a relationship.

I often feel like there might be a disconnect because it's hard for someone who doesn't have anxiety like my bf, to understand whats going on with me. 

It's also very hard to walk away from conversations about my anxiety, because I feel like I've failed him somehow. I usually feel quite useless after a low point, with a feeling I should be apologizing, however much my bf tells me it's okay and not to apologize.

Then 2 days ago he tells me that I'm a pushover, I take time to think about it and realize he's kind of right, we never really fought I've always been frightened of him leaving me so I never really disagree with him and I don't really make decisions I always say ""I don't care"" or ""you decide."" I just don't really know how to express myself, I'm fairly apathetic to most things. Then yesterday he tells me that he thinks our relationship might not last if I continue to be so unpassionate, unmotivated and not the ""dominant guy he'd like."" He said that anything can happen and he still wants to be with me now but he might not forever even if I did change because ""everything is up to chance."" I feel like he already broke up with me, I cried a bit and threw up.

Before this relationship I always thought myself as fairly dominant around my friends but I've always been a quiet introvert in large groups of people but I still have an aggressive side. Also I'm not a stereotypical gay guy either, like if you knew me you wouldn't have any idea that I was, he on the other hand is more effeminate and he has a fairly big ego and a rather large personality. I'm really afraid of losing him I just don't know what to do.

So, naturally, being the caring older brother that I am, I decided to utter retching noises, which actually caused her to run to the bathroom and throw up, much to the dislike of our mother, and to my amusement.

TITLE: someone stole my Jeep Wrangler, and someone wrecked into my parked car
POST: Some scumbag stole my Jeep Wrangler on Friday. It was recovered, stripped and destroyed, in the ghetto of the local major city before I even knew it went missing. After filing some reports and making a few calls I determined that I couldn't go get it any time soon, so I went camping for the weekend - as previously planned. 

When I came back home Sunday, I parked my car in it's usual spot at my apartment and went inside to clean up, drop off gear and get ready to leave - I needed to find the parts to fix what I could, on my Jeep; hopefully I could make it drivable. Instead, about twenty minutes into my routine, my neighbor knocked on my door to notify me that some ass hat wrecked into my parked car while I was inside.

I had to take a day off of work yesterday to sort through this mess. I found the Jeep at the impound lot and discovered that the wheels and tires were stolen, the brand-new catalytic converter was cut off, they ripped out the door lock (instead of unzipping or cutting through the soft top), they sheared through the security console, broke the steering column and ripped out the ignition - after cramming a screwdriver into all of the external locks, permanently fucking them all up. Everything inside was stolen, except for my tent rainfly, which wasn't a whole lot but it still adds to the indignation. I had to buy a complete set of wheels and tires just to drive it out of impound, and wasted several hundred more dollars paying for the tow and impound fees. Also, I'd recently removed full coverage since the Jeep was just sitting around as a leisure vehicle and I hadn't driven it much in the last year or so. So, I get to eat the several thousand dollar cost for the theft. Also, most of the cops I had to deal with were really condescending.

She looks at her watch and says ""You're on in ten, hurry up."" The realization hits me that I'm expected to be on stage in front of an audience in ten minutes. I hustle to my music locker and grab my flute and music folder (I played flute all through school, and still do). I'm thinking the entire time: ""what pieces are we playing?"" I look through the folder and there are at least 40 pieces of random paper falling out. Books, pamphlets, and graded tests are shoved in there; seemingly everything but music.

Now, anxiety hits me that I can't find the music, and I don't even know what pieces they are. The other two girls I'm to perform with walk out onto the stage in front of the crowd (indiscriminate people), and set up. They're waiting for me…. I don't know what to do. I sit in my chair on the stage, knowing that everyone in the crowd is waiting for us to start….but I can't perform. I don't have any idea why I'm there or what I'm supposed to be doing. Everyone stares at me as I panic.

Then I wake up.

I've had this dream several times a week ever since high school. Sometimes it will involve playing my flute; sometimes it will be singing a song for chorus/my band or presenting a paper in class, or even give a speech in front of random strangers. I freeze with the realization that I have no idea how I've gotten there or what I should be doing. It haunts me really, and I really have no clue what it would mean.

The other two girls I'm to perform with walk out onto the stage in front of the crowd (indiscriminate people), and set up. They're waiting for me…. I don't know what to do. I sit in my chair on the stage, knowing that everyone in the crowd is waiting for us to start….but I can't perform. I don't have any idea why I'm there or what I'm supposed to be doing. Everyone stares at me as I panic.

Then I wake up.

I've had this dream several times a week ever since high school. Sometimes it will involve playing my flute; sometimes it will be singing a song for chorus/my band or presenting a paper in class, or even give a speech in front of random strangers. I freeze with the realization that I have no idea how I've gotten there or what I should be doing. It haunts me really, and I really have no clue what it would mean.
TL;DR:  I have a recurring nightmare where I have to perform in front of an audience in a high school setting, but I have no idea why I'm there or what I'm supposed to be doing. What does it mean, Reddit?","  I have a recurring nightmare where I have to perform in front of an audience in a high school setting, but I have no idea why I'm there or what I'm supposed to be doing.
